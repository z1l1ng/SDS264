43,STORY OF THE DOOR,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,uninterrupted.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ravages.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,pointed.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“with a very odd story.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was that?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it. The cheque was genuine.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the words fell into a vein of musing.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"judgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of),The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"like Queer Street, the less I ask.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,another begins.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,man of the name of Hyde.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I can see him this moment.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,last.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,been inexact in any point you had better correct it.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,not a week ago.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"presently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,this again.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of a fiend.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"patients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,other’s company.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,disagreeably preoccupied his mind.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that Henry Jekyll has?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"man. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of his—one Hyde?” he asked.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by questions.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"room, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,enduring hatred.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the entry of the court.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Mr. Hyde, I think?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Dr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“How did you know me?” he asked.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"again,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,acknowledgment of the address.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“By description,” was the reply.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Whose description?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,think you would have lied.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the house.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,servant opened the door.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,key.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Poole,” resumed the other musingly.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,him.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and goes by the laboratory.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well, good-night, Poole.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,a sincere and warm affection.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,THE CAREW MURDER CASE,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,he shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"body,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,while I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"deal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,stick.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"calls him,” said the officer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,welcome in a changed voice.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,heard the news?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,heard them in my dining-room.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,this fellow?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,may advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,great a trust in you.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,lawyer.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hateful business has rather exposed.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,see the letter.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Have you the envelope?” he asked.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,confidence in myself.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,disappearance?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,tight and nodded.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,escape.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"post; “and only circulars by that,” he added.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,might be fished for.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,might shape his future course.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"passion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Just then the servant entered with a note.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,autograph.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,differently sloped.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,thought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,his veins.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,at peace.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,himself to Dr. Lanyon’s.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,glad to get away.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,allusion to one whom I regard as dead.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ground.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,inmost corner of his private safe.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,see more of Mr. Hyde.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and shared your feeling of repulsion?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"I found it out, even when I did.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the presence of a friend might do him good.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will not last long, thank God.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,man mean?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and see for yourself?”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"present purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,“I’ve seen him!”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,asked.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,returned with it to Cavendish Square.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,"injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"“O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"eyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll!",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"man’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"How, then were they dissociated?",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in my soul.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"courage, drank off the potion.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,stature.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"mankind, was pure evil.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,thus his conscience slumbered.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Edward Hyde.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"through the back passage, across the open court and through the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,breakfasting.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,found wanting in the strength to keep to it.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,transforming draught.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to fall.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,under my heel!,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,temptation.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,end to end.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’s,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,hope.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,to the draught.,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
43,"myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my",The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

84,You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my undertaking.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Archangel.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possessed of dauntless courage.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavour to regulate my mind.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in my enterprise.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,otherwise he would command.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,safety of others is committed to my care.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,regions I am about to explore.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. ,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these papers can come into your possession.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distant inequalities of the ice.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,greatest attention.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rest for a few hours.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on the open sea.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,northern pole.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which restored him wonderfully.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in so strange a vehicle.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Yes.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,benevolently restored me to life.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,notice if any new object should appear in sight.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"interested in him, although they have had very little communication","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,so attractive and amiable.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my heart.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,necessary to restore his composure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,retired to his cabin.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these feelings in my answer.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,determined.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,husband and the father of a family.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the world again through his credit and assistance.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,support life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as a restorative for her weakened frame.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one train of enjoyment to me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my pleasures.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sister, since till death she was to be mine only.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,earliest sensations I can remember.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the infidels.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the development of filial love.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ambition.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your time upon this; it is sad trash.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,avidity.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pursuit.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ignorantly I had repined.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a violent death!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,anything so utterly destroyed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,spoiler has not seized.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of commerce.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. ,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repent.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,omitted.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was very different when the masters of the science sought,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shall never forget:,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,procure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"philosophy, including mathematics.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"books which I had requested, and I took my leave.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Chapter 4,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happened that protracted my stay.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,secret.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,animation upon lifeless matter.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ineffectual light.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will allow.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"collecting and arranging my materials, I began.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,brought my work near to a conclusion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,are equally neglected.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should be completed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,both of these when my creation should be complete.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 5,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had so miserably given life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,such as even Dante could not have conceived.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from a black and comfortless sky.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, ,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84," Like one who, on a lonely road,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84," Doth walk in fear and dread,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84," And, having once turned round, walks on,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, And turns no more his head;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, Because he knows a frightful fiend,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, Doth close behind him tread.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, ,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84, [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”],"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the very moment of my alighting!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,knowledge.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,several nights.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,end and that I am at length free.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,laughter frightened and astonished him.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cause of all this?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"recover my senses for a long, long time.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,action that he could towards them.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whom I dared not even think?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your long silence.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,who are so deserving of my love?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your cousin, I believe.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 6,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,own Elizabeth:,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dearest Cousin,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intelligence soon in your own handwriting.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,trials were reserved for her.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,came to the university with the design of making himself complete,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,invincible burden.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,darling child!’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,what has happened?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,survivors.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,although I was unable to define them.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards Geneva.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lake!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,east of the lake.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,murdered my brother?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to destroy all that was dear to me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I resolved to remain silent.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to attend their usual hour of rising.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,William! he was our darling and our pride!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was free last night!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then hear all.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manner.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"good Justine, is innocent.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,poor William.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I had let loose upon the world?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,William.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of her acquittal.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hopeless and despairing.” She wept.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,partiality.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,exculpated her who suffered through me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her utter guiltlessness.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,although variable voice.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,doubtful or suspicious.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Concerning the picture she could give no account.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"jewel, to part with it again so soon?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,innocence.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the court.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,her.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was condemned.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,decisive.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should escape. But she has confessed.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,committed a murder.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I could not refuse.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cousin wept also.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was not so miserable as I am now.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,voice was suffocated with sobs.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"moment, but your own confession.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,miserable.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,am to suffer ignominy and death.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the will of heaven!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had confessed, he did not credit it.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cannot live in this world of misery.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perished on the scaffold as a murderess!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 9,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,such as no language can describe.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,also? No one could love a child more than I loved your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,society.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,among them?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,smiles.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wretch.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,peace?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earth, the habitations of another race of beings.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the giver of oblivion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 10,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gathered round me and bade me be at peace.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,solitary grandeur of the scene.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,convey to us.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,     The path of its departure still is free.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,     Nought may endure but mutability!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,away from the joys of life.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,detestation and contempt.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,so negligently bestowed.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He easily eluded me and said,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in which one must fall.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the sight of your detested form.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your own speedy ruin.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his tale.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,down and wept.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,silence again.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thrush were sweet and enticing.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,into sleep.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,damp substance that covered the ground.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that was sufficient for me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tolerably warm.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,something should occur which might alter my determination. It was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,house and sometimes in the yard.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"window, unable to bear these emotions.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cottage together.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fields.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,science of words or letters.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,after the first meal.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were at first enigmatic.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man when they reserved none for themselves.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cottage and cultivating the garden.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dearest, unhappy._","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man and Agatha.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,advanced.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of these terms.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,afterwards their love.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a lovely pink.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conversation took place between him and his father, and the young","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before understood, but I profited by the others.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it utterly impossible.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dying away like a nightingale of the woods.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the words uttered by my protectors.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was spoken.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,for wonder and delight.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hapless fate of its original inhabitants.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,loathing.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tyrannical mandate.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Germany.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. ,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,employed in their ordinary occupations.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,understanding it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,solve them.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have been imbued with different sensations.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gall of envy rose within me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,image and that inconstant shade.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,believe myself utterly unworthy of it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be tolerated by my younger protectors.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cottage.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,there is something in your words which persuades me that you are,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the ruin.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to reflection on my situation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,party.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,search of food.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,agony of this suspense.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,determination.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,place.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,operations.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this place I resolved to proceed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,any other being that wore the human form.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endured.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the enjoyment of pleasure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this peopled earth.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hurt you; listen to me.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,moment he lay dead at my feet.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,expressive of disgust and affright.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attempt to destroy them.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beloved, awake!’","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"proposition. He continued,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,concede.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your birth.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he calmed himself and proceeded—,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,request!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feeling and continued,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was yet in my power to bestow.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,affording a wider scope for your revenge?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,existence and events from which I am now excluded.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Turning to him, therefore, I said,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appear.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sea of ice.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,way to consume me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and that thought only had to me the reality of life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,compose a female without again devoting several months to profound,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and a more cheerful heart.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"calling me aside, thus addressed me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to feel.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sincerity.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I expected peace.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,slavery for ever.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"return, have restored me entirely to myself.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,contemplate its progress?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,forget the past in my union with her.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,machinations.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,farewell.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me whilst they endured.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enjoyment.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and populous towns occupy the scene.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,our own country.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,    ——The sounding cataract,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"    Their colours and their forms, were then to him","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"    That had no need of a remoter charm,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distinguished natural philosophers.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my soul with anguish.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,stately deer were all novelties to us.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"domes, embosomed among aged trees.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,miserable self.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,congenial to your own temper.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your absence.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"finished, that he might receive his companion.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the mainland, which was about five miles distant.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of men.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in my bosom.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 20,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deserted by one of his own species.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fulfilment of my promise.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,terrible reveries.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,person landed close to my house.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"approached me and said in a smothered voice,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hopes?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,obey!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,words will only exasperate my rage.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,repent of the injuries you inflict.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wedding-night.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,waves.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,before my enemy without a bitter struggle.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dæmon whom I had myself created.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,chemical apparatus.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conclusion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,slept soundly.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,land towards the south.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,escape.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this town and inform me where I am?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,receive strangers so inhospitably.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,this a free country?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,found murdered here last night.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all fear of ignominy or death.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,recollection.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,an unfavourable augury from my manner.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,boat in which I had just landed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was afterwards found.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,quite gone.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,benefactor—”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the wheel, continually renewed the torture?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Are you better now, sir?” said she.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,still alive to feel this misery and horror.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of reality.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hangman who would gain his fee?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,intervals.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mine and addressed me in French,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,make you more comfortable?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have been, can death be any evil to me?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your path.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to say,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,kind.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,now to lament?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and cried out in agony,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,let him enter!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rather a severe tone,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should have died on the coffin of Henry.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gradually recovered my health.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,after my removal I was liberated from prison.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,preyed upon my wasted frame.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,susceptible.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. ","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,died by my hands.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you never to make such an assertion again.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sacrifice the whole human race.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,misfortunes.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to the sea of ice.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,following letter from Elizabeth:,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear Friend,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,comfort and tranquillity.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some explanation necessary before we meet.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the fiend—“_I will be with you on your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should not retard it a single hour.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Elizabeth. I remained silent.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Have you, then, some other attachment?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deprived.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the seal to my fate.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hastened that of a far dearer victim.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,near which it stood.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,one day at least permits me to enjoy.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,appears!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to distraction and reverie.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me and cling to me for ever.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 23,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my adversary was extinguished.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,What is it you fear?”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,into the room.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,breath had ceased to issue from her lips.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,plunged into the lake.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"search the country, parties going in different directions among the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,woods and vines.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had lost.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,man.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my hideous narration.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,revenge on his cursed head.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,authority for the apprehension of the murderer.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be spared to discover the villain.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,on his countenance.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,functions on this occasion.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,punishment which is his desert.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,make up your mind to disappointment.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his destruction.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,some other mode of action.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,Chapter 24,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delirium or death would have been my portion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which had belonged to my mother, and departed.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not die and leave my adversary in being.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mourner.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,torments me.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"determined to live, and I am satisfied.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,mortal speed.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"few drops that revived me, and vanish.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ardent desire of my soul.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,over”—these words were legible in one of these,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hatred.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to meet and grapple with him.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,departed from land.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"oppressed me, I wept aloud.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thus preparing for me a hideous death.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to increase your own.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,posterity.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"never, never again to rise.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,course southwards.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,"Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he said,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will soon return to England.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Do you, then, really return?”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,when I am only induced by reason and virtue.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,may still be misled by passion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,away from his lips.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,consolation.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"Good night, my sister.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,final and wonderful catastrophe.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,I called on him to stay.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,uncontrollable passion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,Frankenstein would yet have lived.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,torture such as you cannot even imagine.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,from your power.”,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,death?,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,"that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to","Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

84,exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"
84,will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"

345,"_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at",Dracula
345,"Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an",Dracula
345,"hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I",Dracula
345,got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the,Dracula
345,"streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived",Dracula
345,late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The,Dracula
345,impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the,Dracula
345,"East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is",Dracula
345,"here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish",Dracula
345,rule.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.",Dracula
345,"Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or",Dracula
345,"rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was",Dracula
345,"very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the",Dracula
345,"waiter, and he said it was called ""paprika hendl,"" and that, as it was a",Dracula
345,"national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the",Dracula
345,"Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I",Dracula
345,don't know how I should be able to get on without it.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the",Dracula
345,"British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library",Dracula
345,regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the,Dracula
345,country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a,Dracula
345,nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the,Dracula
345,"extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,",Dracula
345,"Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian",Dracula
345,mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was,Dracula
345,not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the,Dracula
345,"Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare",Dracula
345,"with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post",Dracula
345,"town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter",Dracula
345,"here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my",Dracula
345,travels with Mina.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:,Dracula
345,"Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the",Dracula
345,"descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the",Dracula
345,"East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended",Dracula
345,"from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered",Dracula
345,the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I,Dracula
345,read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the,Dracula
345,"horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of",Dracula
345,"imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I",Dracula
345,must ask the Count all about them.),Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had",Dracula
345,all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my,Dracula
345,"window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been",Dracula
345,"the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was",Dracula
345,still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous,Dracula
345,"knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.",Dracula
345,"I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour",Dracula
345,"which they said was ""mamaliga,"" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a",Dracula
345,"very excellent dish, which they call ""impletata."" (_Mem._, get recipe",Dracula
345,"for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little",Dracula
345,"before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to",Dracula
345,the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour,Dracula
345,before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the,Dracula
345,more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of,Dracula
345,beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the,Dracula
345,top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by,Dracula
345,rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side,Dracula
345,"of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and",Dracula
345,"running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every",Dracula
345,"station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts",Dracula
345,of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I,Dracula
345,"saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats",Dracula
345,and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women,Dracula
345,"looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy",Dracula
345,"about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,",Dracula
345,and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something,Dracula
345,"fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there",Dracula
345,were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the,Dracula
345,"Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy",Dracula
345,"hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous",Dracula
345,"heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass",Dracula
345,"nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and",Dracula
345,had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very,Dracula
345,"picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be",Dracula
345,"set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,",Dracula
345,"however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural",Dracula
345,self-assertion.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a",Dracula
345,very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the,Dracula
345,Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy,Dracula
345,"existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series",Dracula
345,"of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate",Dracula
345,occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent,Dracula
345,"a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war",Dracula
345,proper being assisted by famine and disease.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I",Dracula
345,"found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of",Dracula
345,course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was,Dracula
345,"evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a",Dracula
345,cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white,Dracula
345,"undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff",Dracula
345,fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and,Dracula
345,"said, ""The Herr Englishman?"" ""Yes,"" I said, ""Jonathan Harker."" She",Dracula
345,"smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,",Dracula
345,"who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with",Dracula
345,a letter:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"     ""My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting",Dracula
345,     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will,Dracula
345,     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo,Dracula
345,     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust,Dracula
345,"     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you",Dracula
345,     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.,Dracula

345,"_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,",Dracula
345,directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on,Dracula
345,"making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and",Dracula
345,pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be,Dracula
345,"true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he",Dracula
345,"answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old",Dracula
345,"lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of",Dracula
345,"way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that",Dracula
345,"was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could",Dracula
345,"tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,",Dracula
345,"and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak",Dracula
345,further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask,Dracula
345,"any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means",Dracula
345,comforting.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a",Dracula
345,very hysterical way:,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?"" She was in such an excited",Dracula
345,"state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and",Dracula
345,mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I,Dracula
345,was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her,Dracula
345,"that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,",Dracula
345,she asked again:,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you know what day it is?"" I answered that it was the fourth of May.",Dracula
345,She shook her head as she said again:,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?"" On",Dracula
345,"my saying that I did not understand, she went on:",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when",Dracula
345,"the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have",Dracula
345,"full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?""",Dracula
345,"She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but",Dracula
345,without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not,Dracula
345,to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very,Dracula
345,"ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business",Dracula
345,"to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore",Dracula
345,"tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked",Dracula
345,"her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and",Dracula
345,"dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I",Dracula
345,"did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been",Dracula
345,"taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it",Dracula
345,seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a,Dracula
345,"state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the",Dracula
345,"rosary round my neck, and said, ""For your mother's sake,"" and went out",Dracula
345,of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting,Dracula
345,"for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still",Dracula
345,"round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly",Dracula
345,"traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I",Dracula
345,am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should,Dracula
345,"ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the",Dracula

345,"_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is",Dracula
345,"high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or",Dracula
345,"hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are",Dracula
345,"mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,",Dracula
345,naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put,Dracula
345,"down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I",Dracula
345,"left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they",Dracula
345,"called ""robber steak""--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red",Dracula
345,"pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple",Dracula
345,"style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which",Dracula
345,"produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not",Dracula
345,"disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him",Dracula
345,"talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every",Dracula
345,"now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting",Dracula
345,on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning,Dracula
345,"""word-bearer""--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them",Dracula
345,"pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for",Dracula
345,there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot,Dracula
345,dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not,Dracula
345,"cheering to me, for amongst them were ""Ordog""--Satan, ""pokol""--hell,",Dracula
345,"""stregoica""--witch, ""vrolok"" and ""vlkoslak""--both of which mean the same",Dracula
345,"thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is",Dracula
345,"either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these",Dracula
345,superstitions),Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time",Dracula
345,"swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and",Dracula
345,pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a,Dracula
345,fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at,Dracula
345,"first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a",Dracula
345,"charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,",Dracula
345,just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one,Dracula
345,"seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I",Dracula
345,could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I,Dracula
345,"had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing",Dracula
345,"themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of",Dracula
345,rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the,Dracula
345,"centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered",Dracula
345,"the whole front of the box-seat--""gotza"" they call them--cracked his big",Dracula
345,"whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on",Dracula
345,our journey.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the,Dracula
345,"scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather",Dracula
345,"languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have",Dracula
345,been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping,Dracula
345,"land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned",Dracula
345,"with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the",Dracula
345,"road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,",Dracula
345,"plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under",Dracula
345,the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these,Dracula
345,"green hills of what they call here the ""Mittel Land"" ran the road,",Dracula
345,"losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the",Dracula
345,"straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the",Dracula
345,"hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we",Dracula
345,seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then,Dracula
345,"what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no",Dracula
345,time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime,Dracula
345,"excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter",Dracula
345,snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in,Dracula
345,"the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept",Dracula
345,"in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the",Dracula
345,"Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,",Dracula
345,and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes,Dracula
345,of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right,Dracula
345,"and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon",Dracula
345,"them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,",Dracula
345,"deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where",Dracula
345,"grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and",Dracula
345,"pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where",Dracula
345,the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the,Dracula
345,"mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again",Dracula
345,the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as,Dracula
345,"we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered",Dracula
345,"peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to",Dracula
345,be right before us:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look! Isten szek!""--""God's seat!""--and he crossed himself reverently.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind",Dracula
345,"us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was",Dracula
345,emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the,Dracula
345,"sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there",Dracula
345,"we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed",Dracula
345,"that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,",Dracula
345,"and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there",Dracula
345,"was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even",Dracula
345,"turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of",Dracula
345,devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were,Dracula
345,"many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here",Dracula
345,"and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems",Dracula
345,shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and,Dracula
345,again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its,Dracula
345,"long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the",Dracula
345,road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming,Dracula
345,"peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their",Dracula
345,"coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long",Dracula
345,"staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,",Dracula
345,and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the,Dracula
345,"gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which",Dracula
345,"ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the",Dracula
345,"Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of",Dracula
345,"late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods",Dracula
345,"that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of",Dracula
345,"greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a",Dracula
345,"peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and",Dracula
345,"grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset",Dracula
345,threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the,Dracula
345,Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the,Dracula
345,"hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could",Dracula
345,"only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,",Dracula
345,"but the driver would not hear of it. ""No, no,"" he said; ""you must not",Dracula
345,"walk here; the dogs are too fierce""; and then he added, with what he",Dracula
345,evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the,Dracula
345,"approving smile of the rest--""and you may have enough of such matters",Dracula
345,"before you go to sleep."" The only stop he would make was a moment's",Dracula
345,pause to light his lamps.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the,Dracula
345,"passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as",Dracula
345,though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully,Dracula
345,"with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on",Dracula
345,to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of,Dracula
345,"patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the",Dracula
345,hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach,Dracula
345,"rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a",Dracula
345,"stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared",Dracula
345,to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each,Dracula
345,side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One,Dracula
345,"by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed",Dracula
345,upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were,Dracula
345,"certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good",Dracula
345,"faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of",Dracula
345,fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at,Dracula
345,Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.,Dracula
345,"Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the",Dracula
345,"passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the",Dracula
345,darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either,Dracula
345,"happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would",Dracula
345,give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for,Dracula
345,some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on,Dracula
345,"the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the",Dracula
345,"air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the",Dracula
345,"mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got",Dracula
345,into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance,Dracula
345,which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the,Dracula
345,glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light,Dracula
345,"was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our",Dracula
345,hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy,Dracula
345,"road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.",Dracula
345,"The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock",Dracula
345,"my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when",Dracula
345,"the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I",Dracula
345,"could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I",Dracula
345,"thought it was ""An hour less than the time."" Then turning to me, he said",Dracula
345,in German worse than my own:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will",Dracula
345,"now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better",Dracula
345,"the next day."" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and",Dracula
345,"snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,",Dracula
345,amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing,Dracula
345,"of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook",Dracula
345,"us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our",Dracula
345,"lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and",Dracula
345,"splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown",Dracula
345,"beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I",Dracula
345,"could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red",Dracula
345,"in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You are early to-night, my friend."" The man stammered in reply:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The English Herr was in a hurry,"" to which the stranger replied:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot",Dracula
345,"deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift."" As he",Dracula
345,"spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with",Dracula
345,"very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my",Dracula
345,"companions whispered to another the line from Burger's ""Lenore"":--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"    ""Denn die Todten reiten schnell""--",Dracula
345,"    (""For the dead travel fast."")",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a",Dracula
345,"gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time",Dracula
345,"putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. ""Give me the Herr's",Dracula
345,"luggage,"" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were",Dracula
345,handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the,Dracula
345,"coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a",Dracula
345,hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been,Dracula
345,"prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we",Dracula
345,swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam,Dracula
345,"from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected",Dracula
345,against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then,Dracula
345,"the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept",Dracula
345,on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a,Dracula
345,"strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown",Dracula
345,"over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in",Dracula
345,excellent German:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all",Dracula
345,care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the,Dracula
345,"country) underneath the seat, if you should require it."" I did not take",Dracula
345,"any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a",Dracula
345,"little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been",Dracula
345,"any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that",Dracula
345,"unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,",Dracula
345,then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It,Dracula
345,seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground,Dracula
345,"again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was",Dracula
345,"so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but",Dracula
345,"I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any",Dracula
345,protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to,Dracula
345,"delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was",Dracula
345,"passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was",Dracula
345,"within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I",Dracula
345,suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my,Dracula
345,recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a,Dracula
345,"long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by",Dracula
345,"another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which",Dracula
345,"now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed",Dracula
345,"to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp",Dracula
345,it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to,Dracula
345,"strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they",Dracula
345,"quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from",Dracula
345,"sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each",Dracula
345,side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which,Dracula
345,affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to,Dracula
345,"jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged",Dracula
345,"madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them",Dracula
345,"from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to",Dracula
345,"the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able",Dracula
345,"to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and",Dracula
345,"whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers",Dracula
345,"doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became",Dracula
345,"quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again",Dracula
345,"took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This",Dracula
345,"time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a",Dracula
345,narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the",Dracula
345,roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning,Dracula
345,"rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we",Dracula
345,"could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the",Dracula
345,"rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.",Dracula
345,"It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,",Dracula
345,so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The,Dracula
345,"keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew",Dracula
345,fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer,Dracula
345,"and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I",Dracula
345,"grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,",Dracula
345,"however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to",Dracula
345,"left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The",Dracula
345,"driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,",Dracula
345,"jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know",Dracula
345,"what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while",Dracula
345,"I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took",Dracula
345,"his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep",Dracula
345,"and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated",Dracula
345,"endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.",Dracula
345,"Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness",Dracula
345,around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where,Dracula
345,"the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem",Dracula
345,"to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,",Dracula
345,formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical,Dracula
345,"effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,",Dracula
345,"for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but",Dracula
345,"as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me",Dracula
345,straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue,Dracula
345,"flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the",Dracula
345,"wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he,Dracula
345,"had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse",Dracula
345,than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause,Dracula
345,"for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just",Dracula
345,"then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the",Dracula
345,"jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw",Dracula
345,"around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,",Dracula
345,"with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more",Dracula
345,terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.,Dracula
345,"For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man",Dracula
345,feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand,Dracula
345,their true import.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had,Dracula
345,"some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and",Dracula
345,looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;,Dracula
345,but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they,Dracula
345,"had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for",Dracula
345,it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the,Dracula
345,ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the,Dracula
345,"calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as",Dracula
345,"to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know",Dracula
345,"not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and",Dracula
345,"looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his",Dracula
345,"long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves",Dracula
345,fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across,Dracula
345,"the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the",Dracula
345,wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a,Dracula
345,"dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time",Dracula
345,"seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete",Dracula
345,"darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on",Dracula
345,"ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main",Dracula
345,"always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the",Dracula
345,driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a,Dracula
345,"vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,",Dracula
345,and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit,Dracula
345,sky.,Dracula

345,CHAPTER II,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully",Dracula
345,awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In,Dracula
345,"the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark",Dracula
345,"ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than",Dracula
345,it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand",Dracula
345,to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious,Dracula
345,strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have,Dracula
345,"crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed",Dracula
345,"them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and",Dracula
345,"studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of",Dracula
345,massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was,Dracula
345,"massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and",Dracula
345,"weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the",Dracula
345,"reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one",Dracula
345,of the dark openings.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell",Dracula
345,or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark,Dracula
345,window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The,Dracula
345,"time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon",Dracula
345,"me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?",Dracula
345,What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a,Dracula
345,customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to,Dracula
345,explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's,Dracula
345,clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving,Dracula
345,London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a,Dracula
345,full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if,Dracula
345,"I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I",Dracula
345,"expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with",Dracula
345,"the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt",Dracula
345,in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the,Dracula
345,"pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake",Dracula
345,"and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to",Dracula
345,wait the coming of the morning.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching,Dracula
345,"behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming",Dracula
345,light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of,Dracula
345,massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise,Dracula
345,"of long disuse, and the great door swung back.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white",Dracula
345,"moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck",Dracula
345,of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver,Dracula
345,"lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,",Dracula
345,throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the,Dracula
345,open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly,Dracula
345,"gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!"" He made no",Dracula
345,"motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his",Dracula
345,"gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that",Dracula
345,"I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and",Dracula
345,"holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,",Dracula
345,an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as,Dracula
345,ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the",Dracula
345,"happiness you bring!"" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to",Dracula
345,"that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that",Dracula
345,for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was,Dracula
345,"speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Count Dracula?"" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;",Dracula
345,"the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest."" As he was",Dracula
345,"speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,",Dracula
345,took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I,Dracula
345,protested but he insisted:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not",Dracula
345,"available. Let me see to your comfort myself."" He insisted on carrying",Dracula
345,"my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and",Dracula
345,"along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang",Dracula
345,"heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced",Dracula
345,"to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,",Dracula
345,"and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,",Dracula
345,flamed and flared.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing",Dracula
345,"the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit",Dracula
345,"by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing",Dracula
345,"through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a",Dracula
345,welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with,Dracula
345,"another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were",Dracula
345,fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself,Dracula
345,"left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the",Dracula
345,door:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your",Dracula
345,"toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come",Dracula
345,"into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have,Dracula
345,"dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,",Dracula
345,I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty,Dracula
345,"toilet, I went into the other room.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the",Dracula
345,"great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of",Dracula
345,"his hand to the table, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse",Dracula
345,"me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.,Dracula
345,"He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed",Dracula
345,"it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of",Dracula
345,pleasure.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant",Dracula
345,"sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to",Dracula
345,"come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in",Dracula
345,"whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy",Dracula
345,"and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is",Dracula
345,"discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall",Dracula
345,"be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take",Dracula
345,"your instructions in all matters.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I",Dracula
345,"fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese",Dracula
345,"and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was",Dracula
345,my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many,Dracula
345,"questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had",Dracula
345,experienced.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn",Dracula
345,"up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,",Dracula
345,at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an,Dracula
345,"opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked",Dracula
345,physiognomy.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the",Dracula
345,"thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and",Dracula
345,hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His,Dracula
345,"eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy",Dracula
345,"hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I",Dracula
345,"could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather",Dracula
345,"cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over",Dracula
345,"the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a",Dracula
345,"man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops",Dracula
345,"extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm",Dracula
345,though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees,Dracula
345,"in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing",Dracula
345,"them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather",Dracula
345,"coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in",Dracula
345,"the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp",Dracula
345,"point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not",Dracula
345,"repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a",Dracula
345,"horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could",Dracula
345,"not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a",Dracula
345,"grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his",Dracula
345,"protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the",Dracula
345,fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the,Dracula
345,window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a,Dracula
345,strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from,Dracula
345,down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes,Dracula
345,"gleamed, and he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!""",Dracula
345,"Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he",Dracula
345,added:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the",Dracula
345,"hunter."" Then he rose and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you",Dracula
345,shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;,Dracula
345,"so sleep well and dream well!"" With a courteous bow, he opened for me",Dracula
345,"himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,",Dracula
345,"which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the",Dracula

345,"_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the",Dracula
345,"last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my",Dracula
345,own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had,Dracula
345,"supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the",Dracula
345,"pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which",Dracula
345,was written:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D."" I set to and",Dracula
345,"enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I",Dracula
345,might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.,Dracula
345,"There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the",Dracula
345,extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service,Dracula
345,"is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.",Dracula
345,The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of,Dracula
345,"my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have",Dracula
345,"been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,",Dracula
345,"though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,",Dracula
345,but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of,Dracula
345,the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my,Dracula
345,"table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I",Dracula
345,could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant,Dracula
345,"anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.",Dracula
345,Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it,Dracula
345,"breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had",Dracula
345,"it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about",Dracula
345,the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was,Dracula
345,"absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing",Dracula
345,materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of,Dracula
345,"library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English",Dracula
345,"books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and",Dracula
345,newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines,Dracula
345,"and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books",Dracula
345,"were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political",Dracula
345,"economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life",Dracula
345,and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the,Dracula
345,"London Directory, the ""Red"" and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the",Dracula
345,"Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the",Dracula
345,Law List.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count",Dracula
345,"entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good",Dracula
345,night's rest. Then he went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that",Dracula
345,"will interest you. These companions""--and he laid his hand on some of",Dracula
345,"the books--""have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever",Dracula
345,"since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours",Dracula
345,of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to,Dracula
345,know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of,Dracula
345,"your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of",Dracula
345,"humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes",Dracula
345,it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.,Dracula
345,"To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But, Count,"" I said, ""you know and speak English thoroughly!"" He bowed",Dracula
345,gravely.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I",Dracula
345,"fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know",Dracula
345,"the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Indeed,"" I said, ""you speak excellently.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not so,"" he answered. ""Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your",Dracula
345,"London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not",Dracula
345,"enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,",Dracula
345,"and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men",Dracula
345,know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am,Dracula
345,"like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his",Dracula
345,"speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long",Dracula
345,master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should,Dracula
345,be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter,Dracula
345,"Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You",Dracula
345,"shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may",Dracula
345,learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make,Dracula
345,"error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be",Dracula
345,"away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many",Dracula
345,"important affairs in hand.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might",Dracula
345,"come into that room when I chose. He answered: ""Yes, certainly,"" and",Dracula
345,added:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are",Dracula
345,"locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that",Dracula
345,"all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with",Dracula
345,"my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand."" I said I was sure of",Dracula
345,"this, and then he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are",Dracula
345,"not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from",Dracula
345,"what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of",Dracula
345,"what strange things there may be.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to,Dracula
345,"talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding",Dracula
345,things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.,Dracula
345,"Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by",Dracula
345,pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most,Dracula
345,"frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked",Dracula
345,"him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for",Dracula
345,"instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue",Dracula
345,flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a,Dracula
345,"certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits",Dracula
345,are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place,Dracula
345,"where treasure has been concealed. ""That treasure has been hidden,"" he",Dracula
345,"went on, ""in the region through which you came last night, there can be",Dracula
345,but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the,Dracula
345,"Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil",Dracula
345,"in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,",Dracula
345,"patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the",Dracula
345,"Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out",Dracula
345,"to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited",Dracula
345,"their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep",Dracula
345,destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader,Dracula
345,"was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been",Dracula
345,"sheltered in the friendly soil.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But how,"" said I, ""can it have remained so long undiscovered, when",Dracula
345,"there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?""",Dracula
345,"The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,",Dracula
345,"sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only",Dracula
345,"appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he",Dracula
345,"can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he",Dracula
345,"would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who",Dracula
345,marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight,Dracula
345,"even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to",Dracula
345,"find these places again?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There you are right,"" I said. ""I know no more than the dead where even",Dracula
345,"to look for them."" Then we drifted into other matters.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come,"" he said at last, ""tell me of London and of the house which you",Dracula
345,"have procured for me."" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my",Dracula
345,own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in,Dracula
345,"order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I",Dracula
345,"passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp",Dracula
345,"lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit",Dracula
345,"in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,",Dracula
345,"reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I",Dracula
345,came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I,Dracula
345,went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in,Dracula
345,"everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its",Dracula
345,surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the,Dracula
345,"subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much",Dracula
345,"more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there",Dracula
345,"I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I",Dracula
345,fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend,Dracula
345,Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be,Dracula
345,"in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my",Dracula
345,"other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at,Dracula
345,Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the,Dracula
345,"necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to",Dracula
345,"Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a",Dracula
345,"place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I",Dracula
345,inscribe here:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to",Dracula
345,"be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place",Dracula
345,"was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,",Dracula
345,"built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of",Dracula
345,"years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with",Dracula
345,rust.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre",Dracula
345,"Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of",Dracula
345,"the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by",Dracula
345,"the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which",Dracula
345,"make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or",Dracula
345,"small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and",Dracula
345,flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all,Dracula
345,"periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone",Dracula
345,"immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with",Dracula
345,"iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or",Dracula
345,"church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading",Dracula
345,"to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from",Dracula
345,"various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling",Dracula
345,"way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must",Dracula
345,"be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very",Dracula
345,large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic,Dracula
345,"asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I had finished, he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to",Dracula
345,live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a,Dracula
345,"day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice",Dracula
345,also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love,Dracula
345,not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not,Dracula
345,"gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and",Dracula
345,sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;,Dracula
345,"and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not",Dracula
345,"attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the",Dracula
345,"shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken",Dracula
345,"battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would",Dracula
345,"be alone with my thoughts when I may."" Somehow his words and his look",Dracula
345,"did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his",Dracula
345,smile look malignant and saturnine.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers",Dracula
345,"together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of",Dracula
345,"the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at",Dracula
345,"England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in",Dracula
345,"certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed",Dracula
345,"that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new",Dracula
345,"estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the",Dracula
345,Yorkshire coast.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. ""Aha!"" he",Dracula
345,"said; ""still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I",Dracula
345,"am informed that your supper is ready."" He took my arm, and we went into",Dracula
345,"the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The",Dracula
345,"Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from",Dracula
345,"home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.",Dracula
345,"After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with",Dracula
345,"me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour",Dracula
345,"after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not",Dracula
345,"say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in",Dracula
345,"every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified",Dracula
345,me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at,Dracula
345,"the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.",Dracula
345,They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to,Dracula
345,"the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and",Dracula
345,"tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere",Dracula
345,can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up,Dracula
345,with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count,Dracula
345,"Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so",Dracula
345,long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of,Dracula
345,"England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by",Dracula
345,"us,"" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to",Dracula
345,"notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the",Dracula

345,_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too,Dracula
345,"diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for",Dracula
345,there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I,Dracula
345,"cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had",Dracula
345,never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on,Dracula
345,me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I,Dracula
345,"could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,",Dracula
345,and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let,Dracula
345,"me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and",Dracula
345,imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say,Dracula
345,at once how I stand--or seem to.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could",Dracula
345,"not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,",Dracula
345,"and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,",Dracula
345,"and heard the Count's voice saying to me, ""Good-morning."" I started, for",Dracula
345,"it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass",Dracula
345,"covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,",Dracula
345,but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's,Dracula
345,"salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.",Dracula
345,"This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I",Dracula
345,could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in,Dracula
345,the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no,Dracula
345,"sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on",Dracula
345,"the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague",Dracula
345,feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at,Dracula
345,"the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was",Dracula
345,"trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half",Dracula
345,"round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his",Dracula
345,"eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at",Dracula
345,"my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which",Dracula
345,"held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed",Dracula
345,so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Take care,"" he said, ""take care how you cut yourself. It is more",Dracula
345,"dangerous than you think in this country."" Then seizing the shaving",Dracula
345,"glass, he went on: ""And this is the wretched thing that has done the",Dracula
345,"mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!"" and",Dracula
345,"opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung",Dracula
345,"out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones",Dracula
345,of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very,Dracula
345,"annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or",Dracula
345,"the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could",Dracula
345,not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that,Dracula
345,as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very,Dracula
345,peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I,Dracula
345,"went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The",Dracula
345,"view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity",Dracula
345,of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A,Dracula
345,stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without,Dracula
345,touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.,Dracula
345,"I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of",Dracula
345,every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my,Dracula
345,helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a,Dracula
345,"few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much",Dracula
345,"as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me",Dracula
345,that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done,Dracula
345,anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I,Dracula
345,"am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of",Dracula
345,one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to,Dracula
345,the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it,Dracula
345,"himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive",Dracula
345,"me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only",Dracula
345,"plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes",Dracula
345,"open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,",Dracula
345,"or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and",Dracula
345,"shall need, all my brains to get through.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below,Dracula
345,"shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into",Dracula
345,"the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making",Dracula
345,"the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along",Dracula
345,thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him,Dracula
345,through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the,Dracula
345,"dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these",Dracula
345,"menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.",Dracula
345,"This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it",Dracula
345,must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that,Dracula
345,"brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it",Dracula
345,"mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his",Dracula
345,hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the,Dracula
345,coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the,Dracula
345,"crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless",Dracula
345,"that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a",Dracula
345,comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing,Dracula
345,which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous,Dracula
345,should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there,Dracula
345,"is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,",Dracula

345,"time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my",Dracula
345,mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count,Dracula
345,"Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of",Dracula
345,"himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,",Dracula
345,"however, not to awake his suspicion.",Dracula

345,_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few,Dracula
345,"questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject",Dracula
345,"wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of",Dracula
345,"battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he",Dracula
345,afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house,Dracula
345,"and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their",Dracula
345,"fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said ""we,""",Dracula
345,"and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put",Dracula
345,"down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most",Dracula
345,fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He,Dracula
345,"grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great",Dracula
345,white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as,Dracula
345,though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I,Dracula
345,shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of,Dracula
345,his race:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood",Dracula
345,"of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,",Dracula
345,"in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from",Dracula
345,"Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their",Dracula
345,"Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,",Dracula
345,"and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the",Dracula
345,"were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found",Dracula
345,"the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,",Dracula
345,till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those,Dracula
345,"old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the",Dracula
345,"desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as",Dracula
345,"Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"" He held up his arms. ""Is it a",Dracula
345,wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the,Dracula
345,"Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his",Dracula
345,"thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when",Dracula
345,Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us,Dracula
345,here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed,Dracula
345,"there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were",Dracula
345,"claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries",Dracula
345,"was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more",Dracula
345,"than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,",Dracula
345,"'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we",Dracula
345,"throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its",Dracula
345,warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was,Dracula
345,"redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the",Dracula
345,flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who,Dracula
345,was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat,Dracula
345,the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that,Dracula
345,"his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the",Dracula
345,"Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,",Dracula
345,"indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and",Dracula
345,"again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,",Dracula
345,"when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had",Dracula
345,to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being,Dracula
345,"slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They",Dracula
345,said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants,Dracula
345,without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to,Dracula
345,"conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the",Dracula
345,"Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for",Dracula
345,"our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the",Dracula
345,"Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and",Dracula
345,their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the,Dracula
345,Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.,Dracula
345,Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and,Dracula
345,"the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.""",Dracula

345,"_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by",Dracula
345,"books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not",Dracula
345,confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own,Dracula
345,"observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from",Dracula
345,his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the,Dracula
345,doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over,Dracula
345,"books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the",Dracula
345,matters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain,Dracula
345,"method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in",Dracula
345,sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I",Dracula
345,"told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be",Dracula
345,"wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only",Dracula
345,"one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate",Dracula
345,"against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to",Dracula
345,ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to,Dracula
345,"attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case",Dracula
345,local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking,Dracula
345,"solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any",Dracula
345,"chance mislead him, so he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under",Dracula
345,"the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from",Dracula
345,"London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now",Dracula
345,"here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have",Dracula
345,sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one,Dracula
345,"resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be",Dracula
345,"served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,",Dracula
345,"have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to",Dracula
345,"seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose",Dracula
345,"I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or",Dracula
345,"Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more",Dracula
345,"ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?"" I answered that",Dracula
345,"certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of",Dracula
345,"agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on",Dracula
345,"instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing",Dracula
345,"himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by",Dracula
345,him without further trouble.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Of course,"" I replied; and ""such is often done by men of business, who",Dracula
345,"do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good!"" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making",Dracula
345,"consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of",Dracula
345,"difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded",Dracula
345,"against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,",Dracula
345,and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a,Dracula
345,"wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or",Dracula
345,"foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not",Dracula
345,"evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were",Dracula
345,wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had,Dracula
345,"spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books",Dracula
345,"available, he suddenly stood up and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter",Dracula
345,"Hawkins, or to any other?"" It was with some bitterness in my heart that",Dracula
345,"I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of",Dracula
345,sending letters to anybody.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then write now, my young friend,"" he said, laying a heavy hand on my",Dracula
345,"shoulder: ""write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will",Dracula
345,"please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you wish me to stay so long?"" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the",Dracula
345,thought.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,",Dracula
345,"employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,",Dracula
345,it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not,Dracula
345,"stinted. Is it not so?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not",Dracula
345,"mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count",Dracula
345,"Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing",Dracula
345,"which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I",Dracula
345,"could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his",Dracula
345,"mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but",Dracula
345,"in his own smooth, resistless way:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things",Dracula
345,other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your,Dracula
345,"friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting",Dracula
345,"home to them. Is it not so?"" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of",Dracula
345,note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign,Dracula
345,"post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,",Dracula
345,"with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood",Dracula
345,"as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for",Dracula
345,he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes,Dracula
345,"now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for",Dracula
345,"to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he",Dracula
345,"did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a",Dracula
345,"book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to",Dracula
345,some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his,Dracula
345,"own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door",Dracula
345,"had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which",Dracula
345,"were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for",Dracula
345,under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way,Dracula
345,I could.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The",Dracula
345,"Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to",Dracula
345,"Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,",Dracula
345,"bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just",Dracula
345,about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my,Dracula
345,"seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and",Dracula
345,"to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his",Dracula
345,"hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped",Dracula
345,"them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this",Dracula
345,"evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish."" At the door he",Dracula
345,"turned, and after a moment's pause said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all",Dracula
345,"seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any",Dracula
345,"chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has",Dracula
345,"many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be",Dracula
345,"warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then",Dracula
345,"haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be",Dracula
345,"safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then""--He finished his",Dracula
345,"speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were",Dracula
345,washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any,Dracula
345,"dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom",Dracula
345,and mystery which seemed closing around me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no",Dracula
345,doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is,Dracula
345,not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that,Dracula
345,my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any",Dracula
345,"sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out",Dracula
345,"towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,",Dracula
345,"inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness",Dracula
345,"of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in",Dracula
345,"prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of",Dracula
345,the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.,Dracula
345,"It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all",Dracula
345,sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my,Dracula
345,terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful,Dracula
345,"expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as",Dracula
345,"day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows",Dracula
345,in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed,Dracula
345,to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I,Dracula
345,leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey,Dracula
345,"below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of",Dracula
345,"the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The",Dracula
345,"window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though",Dracula
345,"weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since",Dracula
345,"the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked",Dracula
345,carefully out.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not,Dracula
345,"see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his",Dracula
345,back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had,Dracula
345,so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and,Dracula
345,"somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest",Dracula
345,and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to,Dracula
345,repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the,Dracula
345,"window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,",Dracula
345,_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At,Dracula
345,first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the,Dracula
345,"moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could",Dracula
345,be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the,Dracula
345,"stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus",Dracula
345,using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable,Dracula
345,"speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the",Dracula
345,semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering,Dracula
345,me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am,Dracula
345,encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....,Dracula

345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.,Dracula
345,"He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good",Dracula
345,deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head,Dracula
345,"had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without",Dracula
345,avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I,Dracula
345,"knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to",Dracula
345,"explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and",Dracula
345,"taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had",Dracula
345,"expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the",Dracula
345,stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could,Dracula
345,pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the,Dracula
345,"door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's",Dracula
345,"room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and",Dracula
345,escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs,Dracula
345,"and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two",Dracula
345,"small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in",Dracula
345,"them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,",Dracula
345,"however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it",Dracula
345,"seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,",Dracula
345,"and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came",Dracula
345,"from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door",Dracula
345,rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have,Dracula
345,"again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that",Dracula
345,I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right,Dracula
345,than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could,Dracula
345,"see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the",Dracula
345,windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter,Dracula
345,"side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle",Dracula
345,"was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was",Dracula
345,"quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or",Dracula
345,"bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,",Dracula
345,"impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the",Dracula
345,"west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged",Dracula
345,"mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with",Dracula
345,"mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and",Dracula
345,crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle,Dracula
345,"occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of",Dracula
345,"comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the",Dracula
345,"yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to",Dracula
345,"see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over",Dracula
345,all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My,Dracula
345,"lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was",Dracula
345,"glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place",Dracula
345,"which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better",Dracula
345,than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the,Dracula
345,"presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I",Dracula
345,"found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak",Dracula
345,"table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much",Dracula
345,"thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my",Dracula
345,diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is,Dracula
345,"nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my",Dracula
345,"senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own",Dracula
345,"which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill.",Dracula

345,"Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not",Dracula
345,"go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it",Dracula
345,is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this,Dracula
345,hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I,Dracula
345,"can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his",Dracula
345,"purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way",Dracula
345,lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which,Dracula
345,have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant,Dracula
345,when he made Hamlet say:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"    ""My tablets! quick, my tablets!",Dracula
345,"    'Tis meet that I put it down,"" etc.,",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock",Dracula
345,"had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.",Dracula
345,The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens,Dracula
345,"me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon",Dracula
345,me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and,Dracula
345,"pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,",Dracula
345,"but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,",Dracula
345,and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft,Dracula
345,"moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom",Dracula
345,which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the,Dracula
345,"gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat",Dracula
345,and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for,Dracula
345,their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great,Dracula
345,"couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look",Dracula
345,"at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for",Dracula
345,"the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen",Dracula
345,"asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly",Dracula
345,"real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the",Dracula
345,"morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I",Dracula
345,"came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,",Dracula
345,my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of,Dracula
345,"dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by",Dracula
345,their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming,Dracula
345,"when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw",Dracula
345,"no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some",Dracula
345,"time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline",Dracula
345,"noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be",Dracula
345,almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was,Dracula
345,"fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes",Dracula
345,"like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it",Dracula
345,"in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the",Dracula
345,moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like,Dracula
345,pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something,Dracula
345,"about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some",Dracula
345,"deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would",Dracula
345,"kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some",Dracula
345,day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.,Dracula
345,"They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a",Dracula
345,"silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have",Dracula
345,"come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,",Dracula
345,tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.,Dracula
345,"The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her",Dracula
345,on. One said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to",Dracula
345,"begin."" The other added:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all."" I lay quiet,",Dracula
345,looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.,Dracula
345,The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement,Dracula
345,"of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent",Dracula
345,"the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter",Dracula
345,"underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under",Dracula
345,"the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply",Dracula
345,gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling,Dracula
345,"and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips",Dracula
345,"like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining",Dracula
345,on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp,Dracula
345,teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of,Dracula
345,my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she,Dracula
345,"paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked",Dracula
345,"her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the",Dracula
345,skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that,Dracula
345,"is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,",Dracula
345,"shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,",Dracula
345,"and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.",Dracula
345,I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating,Dracula
345,heart.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as",Dracula
345,"lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his",Dracula
345,being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I,Dracula
345,saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with,Dracula
345,"giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the",Dracula
345,"white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with",Dracula
345,"passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to",Dracula
345,the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light,Dracula
345,"in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His",Dracula
345,"face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;",Dracula
345,the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar,Dracula
345,"of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman",Dracula
345,"from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating",Dracula
345,them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the,Dracula
345,"wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to",Dracula
345,cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when",Dracula
345,"I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware",Dracula
345,"how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me."" The fair girl,",Dracula
345,"with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You yourself never loved; you never love!"" On this the other women",Dracula
345,"joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the",Dracula
345,room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure,Dracula
345,"of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,",Dracula
345,and said in a soft whisper:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it",Dracula
345,"not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall",Dracula
345,"kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work",Dracula
345,"to be done.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Are we to have nothing to-night?"" said one of them, with a low laugh,",Dracula
345,"as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which",Dracula
345,moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he,Dracula
345,nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my,Dracula
345,"ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a",Dracula
345,"half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with",Dracula
345,"horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful",Dracula
345,"bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me",Dracula
345,without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the,Dracula
345,"moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the",Dracula
345,"dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.",Dracula

345,"I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must",Dracula
345,"have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but",Dracula
345,"could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were",Dracula
345,"certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by",Dracula
345,"in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am",Dracula
345,"rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and",Dracula
345,"many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been",Dracula
345,"evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or",Dracula
345,"another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one",Dracula
345,thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed,Dracula
345,"me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I",Dracula
345,am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not,Dracula
345,have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this,Dracula
345,"room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of",Dracula
345,"sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who",Dracula
345,were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.,Dracula

345,"_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for",Dracula
345,I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the,Dracula
345,stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the,Dracula
345,jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt,Dracula
345,"of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.",Dracula
345,"I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in,Dracula
345,"the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here",Dracula
345,"was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,",Dracula
345,another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the,Dracula
345,"letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at",Dracula
345,"Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state",Dracula
345,of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I,Dracula
345,am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his,Dracula
345,"suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and",Dracula
345,"that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to",Dracula
345,prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a,Dracula
345,chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath,Dracula
345,which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained,Dracula
345,"to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would",Dracula
345,ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much,Dracula
345,"impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would",Dracula
345,be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my,Dracula
345,"prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new",Dracula
345,"suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked",Dracula
345,"him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and",Dracula
345,then said:--,Dracula

345,"send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are",Dracula
345,encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of,Dracula
345,"them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though",Dracula
345,allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands,Dracula
345,"of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.",Dracula
345,"They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and",Dracula
345,"call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,",Dracula
345,"save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany",Dracula
345,tongue.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them",Dracula

345,"come, I shall, of course, take care. See!""--he must have looked at",Dracula

345,"he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and",Dracula
345,"the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--""the",Dracula
345,"other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is",Dracula
345,"not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us."" And he calmly held letter",Dracula
345,and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he,Dracula
345,went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is",Dracula
345,"yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that",Dracula
345,"unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?"" He held",Dracula
345,"out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean",Dracula
345,envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When,Dracula
345,he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later,Dracula
345,"I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his",Dracula
345,"coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very",Dracula

345,"sleeping, he said:--",Dracula

345,"""So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I",Dracula
345,"may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours",Dracula

345,and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.,Dracula
345,"With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great",Dracula
345,"leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of",Dracula
345,"each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty",Dracula
345,"sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I",Dracula
345,"ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the",Dracula
345,"main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a",Dracula
345,shock: my door was fastened on the outside.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me,Dracula
345,"stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany came out,",Dracula
345,"and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they",Dracula
345,"laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised",Dracula
345,"entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.",Dracula
345,"The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick",Dracula
345,rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks,Dracula
345,"handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When",Dracula
345,they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the,Dracula
345,"yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on",Dracula
345,"it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I",Dracula

345,"_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and",Dracula
345,locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the,Dracula
345,"winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I",Dracula
345,"thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.",Dracula
345,The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of,Dracula
345,"some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound",Dracula
345,"as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some",Dracula
345,ruthless villainy.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw",Dracula
345,something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched,Dracula
345,"carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to",Dracula
345,find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst,Dracula
345,"travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I",Dracula
345,"had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,",Dracula
345,"and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will",Dracula
345,"allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave",Dracula
345,evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own,Dracula
345,"letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local",Dracula
345,people be attributed to me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up",Dracula
345,"here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which",Dracula
345,is even a criminal's right and consolation.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat",Dracula
345,doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some,Dracula
345,quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were,Dracula
345,"like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in",Dracula
345,clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of,Dracula
345,"soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the",Dracula
345,"embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more",Dracula
345,fully the aërial gambolling.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far",Dracula
345,"below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to",Dracula
345,"ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to",Dracula
345,the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to,Dracula
345,"awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,",Dracula
345,and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I,Dracula
345,was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the,Dracula
345,moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom,Dracula
345,beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom,Dracula
345,"shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my",Dracula
345,"senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were",Dracula
345,"becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the",Dracula
345,"three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat",Dracula
345,"safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp",Dracula
345,was burning brightly.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the,Dracula
345,"Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then",Dracula
345,"there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a",Dracula
345,"beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and",Dracula
345,could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a,Dracula
345,"woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between",Dracula
345,"the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her",Dracula
345,hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning,Dracula
345,against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she,Dracula
345,"threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Monster, give me my child!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same",Dracula
345,words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her,Dracula
345,"breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant",Dracula
345,"emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see",Dracula
345,"her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the",Dracula
345,"Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be",Dracula
345,answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes,Dracula
345,"had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,",Dracula
345,through the wide entrance into the courtyard.,Dracula

345,"There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but",Dracula

345,"Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone",Dracula

345,"_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have",Dracula
345,come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I,Dracula
345,went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south,Dracula
345,"side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs",Dracula
345,"around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,",Dracula
345,and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I,Dracula
345,"took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down",Dracula
345,"once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would",Dracula
345,"not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty",Dracula
345,"well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it",Dracula
345,"as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did",Dracula
345,not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed,Dracula
345,ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and,Dracula
345,"trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when",Dracula
345,I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked,Dracula
345,"around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.",Dracula
345,"The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which",Dracula
345,seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same,Dracula
345,"style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked",Dracula
345,"for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it",Dracula
345,anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one,Dracula
345,"corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and",Dracula
345,"Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as",Dracula
345,though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was,Dracula
345,"less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,",Dracula
345,"some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I",Dracula
345,"could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which",Dracula
345,"was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or",Dracula
345,"all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone",Dracula
345,"passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,",Dracula
345,"minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit",Dracula
345,"by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,",Dracula
345,"tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the",Dracula
345,odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell,Dracula
345,grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood,Dracula
345,"ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently",Dracula
345,"been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were",Dracula
345,"steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and",Dracula
345,"the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been",Dracula
345,"brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for",Dracula
345,"any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of",Dracula
345,"the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the",Dracula
345,"vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to",Dracula
345,"my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments",Dracula
345,"of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a",Dracula
345,discovery.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a",Dracula
345,"pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I",Dracula
345,"could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the",Dracula
345,glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all,Dracula
345,their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of,Dracula
345,"movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,",Dracula
345,"and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain",Dracula
345,"there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.",Dracula
345,"By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.",Dracula
345,"I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw",Dracula
345,"the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,",Dracula
345,"though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and",Dracula
345,"leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle",Dracula
345,"wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried",Dracula
345,to think....,Dracula

345,"_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has",Dracula
345,"taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the",Dracula
345,"castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,",Dracula
345,"lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might",Dracula
345,destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would,Dracula
345,"have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared",Dracula
345,"to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there",Dracula
345,till I fell asleep.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can",Dracula
345,look as he said:--,Dracula

345,"here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the",Dracula
345,"Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some",Dracula
345,"Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall",Dracula
345,bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to,Dracula
345,Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle,Dracula
345,"Dracula."" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.",Dracula
345,Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in,Dracula
345,"connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why may I not go to-night?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once."" He smiled,",Dracula
345,"such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick",Dracula
345,behind his smoothness. He said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And your baggage?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my",Dracula
345,"eyes, it seemed so real:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is",Dracula
345,that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting,Dracula

345,"in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that",Dracula
345,"you so suddenly desire it. Come!"" With a stately gravity, he, with the",Dracula
345,"lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he",Dracula
345,stopped.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Hark!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the,Dracula
345,"sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great",Dracula
345,orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause,Dracula
345,"of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back",Dracula
345,"the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it",Dracula
345,open.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I",Dracula
345,"looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder",Dracula
345,"and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed",Dracula
345,"feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that",Dracula
345,to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such,Dracula
345,"allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door",Dracula
345,"continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.",Dracula
345,Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my,Dracula
345,"doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There",Dracula
345,"was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and",Dracula
345,as a last chance I cried out:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!"" and covered my face with my",Dracula
345,hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his,Dracula
345,"powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged",Dracula
345,and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went",Dracula
345,to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand,Dracula
345,"to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that",Dracula
345,Judas in hell might be proud of.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a",Dracula
345,whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears,Dracula
345,"deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have",Dracula
345,"patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!"" There was a low,",Dracula
345,"sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw",Dracula
345,without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they,Dracula
345,"all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near,Dracula

345,"_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this",Dracula
345,"diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself",Dracula
345,"on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me",Dracula
345,ready.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning",Dracula
345,"had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.",Dracula
345,"With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen",Dracula
345,"that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands",Dracula
345,"that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the",Dracula
345,massive bolts.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at",Dracula
345,"the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its",Dracula
345,casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the,Dracula
345,Count.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I",Dracula
345,determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's,Dracula
345,"room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of",Dracula
345,"evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled",Dracula
345,"down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that",Dracula
345,"was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold",Dracula
345,remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding,Dracula
345,stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well,Dracula
345,enough where to find the monster I sought.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid",Dracula
345,"was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their",Dracula
345,"places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so",Dracula
345,"I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw",Dracula
345,"something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,",Dracula
345,"but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair",Dracula
345,"and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,",Dracula
345,and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than,Dracula
345,"ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the",Dracula
345,"corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,",Dracula
345,"burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches",Dracula
345,underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were,Dracula
345,"simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his",Dracula
345,"repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in",Dracula
345,"me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The",Dracula
345,coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those,Dracula
345,"horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the",Dracula
345,key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile,Dracula
345,on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I,Dracula
345,"was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come",Dracula
345,"he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and",Dracula
345,create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the,Dracula
345,helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me,Dracula
345,"to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,",Dracula
345,but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the,Dracula
345,"cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the",Dracula
345,"hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full",Dracula
345,"upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to",Dracula
345,"paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,",Dracula
345,merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my,Dracula
345,"hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade",Dracula
345,"caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid",Dracula
345,"thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,",Dracula
345,blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its,Dracula
345,own in the nethermost hell.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed",Dracula
345,"on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I",Dracula
345,waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming,Dracula
345,"closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the",Dracula
345,cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had,Dracula
345,spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which,Dracula
345,"contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's",Dracula
345,"room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.",Dracula
345,"With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the",Dracula
345,key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must,Dracula
345,"have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of",Dracula
345,the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and,Dracula
345,dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to,Dracula
345,"run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;",Dracula
345,"but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the",Dracula
345,door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from,Dracula
345,"the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was",Dracula
345,"hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing",Dracula
345,round me more closely.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet,Dracula
345,"and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,",Dracula
345,with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the,Dracula
345,box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again,Dracula
345,"along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key",Dracula
345,in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and,Dracula
345,shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,",Dracula
345,"the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the",Dracula
345,distance.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,",Dracula
345,and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!,Dracula

345,I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall,Dracula

345,"I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together",Dracula
345,freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard,Dracula
345,"lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have",Dracula
345,been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall,Dracula
345,"be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I",Dracula
345,can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for,Dracula
345,"him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He",Dracula
345,"and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a",Dracula
345,stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I,Dracula
345,shall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those,Dracula
345,"two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a",Dracula
345,sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not,Dracula
345,suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not,Dracula
345,intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it,Dracula
345,"anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try",Dracula
345,to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing,Dracula
345,"descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with",Dracula
345,"a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears",Dracula
345,"said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little",Dracula
345,plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan,Dracula
345,"from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I",Dracula
345,am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange,Dracula

345,"wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your",Dracula
345,"_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing",Dracula
345,"to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal",Dracula
345,to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the,Dracula
345,"tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the",Dracula
345,last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.,Dracula
345,"Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well",Dracula
345,together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some,Dracula
345,"time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already",Dracula
345,"engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well",Dracula
345,"off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He",Dracula
345,"is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under",Dracula
345,"his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to",Dracula
345,"see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men",Dracula
345,"I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I",Dracula
345,can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has,Dracula
345,"a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to",Dracula
345,"read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter",Dracula
345,myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do,Dracula
345,"you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not",Dracula
345,"a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you",Dracula
345,have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological,Dracula
345,"study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient",Dracula
345,interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a,Dracula
345,"bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.",Dracula

345,"it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You",Dracula
345,"will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell",Dracula
345,Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think,Dracula
345,"so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to",Dracula
345,"be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always",Dracula
345,"quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just",Dracula
345,"before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum",Dracula
345,"man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool",Dracula
345,"outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling",Dracula
345,"himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he",Dracula
345,"almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do",Dracula
345,"when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept",Dracula
345,playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to,Dracula
345,"me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,",Dracula
345,"though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to",Dracula
345,help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I,Dracula
345,"did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute",Dracula
345,and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if,Dracula
345,"I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,",Dracula
345,and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one,Dracula
345,"else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my",Dracula
345,"confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was",Dracula
345,"free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to",Dracula
345,"tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he",Dracula
345,"stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my",Dracula
345,"hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever",Dracula
345,"wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't",Dracula
345,help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being,Dracula
345,"proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at",Dracula
345,"all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know",Dracula
345,"loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to",Dracula
345,"know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing",Dracula
345,"quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so",Dracula

345,"""_Evening._",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left",Dracula
345,"off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two",Dracula
345,"came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and",Dracula
345,he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he,Dracula
345,has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise,Dracula
345,with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her,Dracula
345,"ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that",Dracula
345,"we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now",Dracula
345,"what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I",Dracula
345,"don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never",Dracula
345,"told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.",Dracula
345,Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl,Dracula
345,"alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I",Dracula
345,helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you,Dracula
345,"beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,",Dracula
345,"he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well",Dracula
345,educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me,Dracula
345,"to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there",Dracula
345,"was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my",Dracula
345,"dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he",Dracula
345,has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall,Dracula
345,"ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never",Dracula
345,"heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked",Dracula
345,"as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was",Dracula
345,"very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your",Dracula
345,"little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you",Dracula
345,will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't,Dracula
345,you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road,Dracula
345,"together, driving in double harness?'",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem",Dracula
345,"half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as",Dracula
345,"lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I",Dracula
345,wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in,Dracula
345,"a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so",Dracula
345,"on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He",Dracula
345,"really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help",Dracula
345,"feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid",Dracula
345,flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was,Dracula
345,"number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he",Dracula
345,"began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very",Dracula
345,heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall,Dracula
345,"never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,",Dracula
345,because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face,Dracula
345,"which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of",Dracula
345,manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here",Dracula
345,"speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right",Dracula
345,"through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow",Dracula
345,"to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is",Dracula
345,"I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will",Dracula
345,"let me, a very faithful friend.'",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy",Dracula
345,"of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true",Dracula
345,"gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think",Dracula
345,this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very,Dracula
345,"badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want",Dracula
345,"her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say",Dracula
345,"it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into",Dracula
345,"Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he",Dracula
345,"even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a",Dracula
345,"light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I",Dracula
345,think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of",Dracula
345,winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't,Dracula
345,"cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it",Dracula
345,"standing up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd",Dracula
345,"better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,",Dracula
345,"your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a",Dracula
345,"lover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty",Dracula
345,lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?,Dracula
345,"It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you",Dracula
345,"know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,",Dracula
345,"my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken",Dracula
345,"yet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and",Dracula
345,"noble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and",Dracula
345,"kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down",Dracula
345,into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these",Dracula
345,things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet,Dracula
345,"honesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,",Dracula
345,"went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a",Dracula
345,"quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like",Dracula
345,that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would,Dracula
345,worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only,Dracula
345,"I don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I",Dracula

345,"_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and",Dracula
345,"lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in",Dracula
345,"which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the",Dracula
345,"Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the",Dracula
345,"harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the",Dracula
345,view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is,Dracula
345,"beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land",Dracula
345,"on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to",Dracula
345,see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all,Dracula
345,"red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the",Dracula
345,pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby,Dracula
345,"Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of",Dracula
345,"""Marmion,"" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble",Dracula
345,"ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is",Dracula
345,a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and,Dracula
345,"the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big",Dracula
345,"graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in",Dracula
345,"Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the",Dracula
345,harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness,Dracula
345,stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that,Dracula
345,"part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been",Dracula
345,destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches,Dracula
345,"out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside",Dracula
345,"them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long",Dracula
345,looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and,Dracula
345,"sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my",Dracula
345,"book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are",Dracula
345,sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and,Dracula
345,talk.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall",Dracula
345,"stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in",Dracula
345,the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside,Dracula
345,"of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,",Dracula
345,and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a,Dracula
345,"narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to,Dracula
345,"nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between",Dracula
345,"banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this",Dracula
345,"side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of",Dracula
345,which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of,Dracula
345,"it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a",Dracula
345,mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is,Dracula
345,lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he,Dracula
345,is coming this way....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all",Dracula
345,gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is,Dracula
345,"nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing",Dracula
345,"fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical",Dracula
345,"person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady",Dracula
345,at the abbey he said very brusquely:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.",Dracula
345,"Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in",Dracula
345,"my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,",Dracula
345,but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and,Dracula
345,Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin',Dracula
345,out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be,Dracula
345,"bothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of",Dracula
345,"fool-talk."" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting",Dracula
345,"things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about",Dracula
345,the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin,Dracula
345,"when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like",Dracula
345,"to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down",Dracula
345,the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from,Dracula
345,"the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how",Dracula
345,many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that,Dracula
345,a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally,Dracula
345,have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went,Dracula

345,"did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in",Dracula

345,"as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a",Dracula
345,"horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,",Dracula
345,"he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger",Dracula

345,"gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must",Dracula
345,watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem,Dracula
345,"in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always",Dracula

345,"that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory",Dracula
345,proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to,Dracula
345,"invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous",Dracula
345,(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he,Dracula
345,"can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He",Dracula
345,"gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then",Dracula
345,wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later,Dracula
345,steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It,Dracula
345,might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at,Dracula

345,"_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting",Dracula
345,"dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should",Dracula
345,feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last,Dracula
345,letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable,Dracula
345,"than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and",Dracula
345,the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and,Dracula
345,"learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is",Dracula
345,"hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except",Dracula
345,"the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;",Dracula
345,"grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the",Dracula
345,"grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea",Dracula
345,"is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,",Dracula
345,muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey,Dracula
345,"mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and",Dracula
345,"there is a ""brool"" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.",Dracula
345,"Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in",Dracula
345,"the mist, and seem ""men like trees walking."" The fishing-boats are",Dracula
345,"racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into",Dracula
345,"the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is",Dracula
345,"making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that",Dracula
345,he wants to talk....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat,Dracula
345,"down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I want to say something to you, miss."" I could see he was not at ease,",Dracula
345,so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak,Dracula
345,"fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked",Dracula
345,"things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;",Dracula
345,"but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We",Dracula
345,"aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't",Dracula
345,"altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;",Dracula
345,"an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my",Dracula
345,"own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a",Dracula
345,bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at,Dracula
345,"hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to",Dracula
345,expect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his,Dracula
345,"scythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at",Dracula
345,once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of,Dracula
345,"Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my",Dracula
345,"deary!""--for he saw that I was crying--""if he should come this very",Dracula
345,"night I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a",Dracula
345,waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that,Dracula
345,"we can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my",Dracula
345,"deary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and",Dracula
345,wonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with,Dracula
345,"it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!"" he",Dracula
345,"cried suddenly. ""There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont",Dracula

345,"moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got",Dracula

345,"off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""I can't make her out,"" he said; ""she's a Russian, by the look of her;",Dracula
345,but she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind,Dracula
345,"a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to",Dracula
345,"run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is",Dracula
345,"steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;",Dracula

345,_Whitby_.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been,Dracula
345,"experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had",Dracula
345,"been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of",Dracula
345,"August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great",Dracula
345,"body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,",Dracula
345,"Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in",Dracula
345,the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made,Dracula
345,"trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of",Dracula
345,"""tripping"" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the",Dracula
345,"afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff",Dracula
345,"churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of",Dracula
345,"sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of",Dracula
345,"""mares'-tails"" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then",Dracula
345,blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical,Dracula
345,"language is ranked ""No. 2: light breeze."" The coastguard on duty at once",Dracula
345,"made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has",Dracula
345,"kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic",Dracula
345,manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very,Dracula
345,"beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that",Dracula
345,there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old,Dracula
345,churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black,Dracula
345,"mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its",Dracula
345,"downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,",Dracula
345,"purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and",Dracula
345,"there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all",Dracula
345,"sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The",Dracula
345,"experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the",Dracula
345,"sketches of the ""Prelude to the Great Storm"" will grace the R. A. and R.",Dracula
345,I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and,Dracula
345,"there that his ""cobble"" or his ""mule,"" as they term the different",Dracula
345,"classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.",Dracula
345,"The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there",Dracula
345,"was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on",Dracula
345,"the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There",Dracula
345,"were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,",Dracula
345,"which usually ""hug"" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but",Dracula
345,few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign,Dracula
345,"schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The",Dracula
345,foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for,Dracula
345,"comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal",Dracula
345,her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she,Dracula
345,was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating,Dracula
345,"swell of the sea,",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"    ""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite,Dracula
345,"oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep",Dracula
345,"inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the",Dracula
345,"band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the",Dracula
345,great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a,Dracula
345,"strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to",Dracula
345,"carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the",Dracula
345,"time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,",Dracula
345,the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in,Dracula
345,"growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes",Dracula
345,the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.,Dracula
345,White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the,Dracula
345,"shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept",Dracula
345,the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier,Dracula
345,"of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such",Dracula
345,"force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,",Dracula
345,or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary,Dracula
345,"to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the",Dracula
345,fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to,Dracula
345,"the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came",Dracula
345,"drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,",Dracula
345,so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of,Dracula
345,imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were,Dracula
345,"touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many",Dracula
345,a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist,Dracula
345,"cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the",Dracula
345,"lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals",Dracula
345,of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock,Dracula
345,of the footsteps of the storm.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of,Dracula
345,"absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with",Dracula
345,"each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to",Dracula
345,"snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with",Dracula
345,"a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again",Dracula
345,the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East,Dracula
345,"Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been",Dracula
345,"tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in",Dracula
345,the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.,Dracula
345,"Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,",Dracula
345,"with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance",Dracula
345,"of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the",Dracula
345,piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of,Dracula
345,"joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed",Dracula
345,to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner,Dracula
345,"with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed",Dracula
345,"earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,",Dracula
345,and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they,Dracula
345,realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the,Dracula
345,port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time,Dracula
345,"to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,",Dracula
345,it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the,Dracula
345,"harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so",Dracula
345,great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost,Dracula
345,"visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such",Dracula
345,"speed that, in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere,",Dracula
345,"if it was only in hell."" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than",Dracula
345,"any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things",Dracula
345,"like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,",Dracula
345,"for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the",Dracula
345,booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder,Dracula
345,than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour,Dracula
345,"mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited",Dracula
345,"breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant",Dracula
345,"of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between",Dracula
345,"the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,",Dracula
345,"swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and",Dracula
345,"gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a",Dracula
345,"shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a",Dracula
345,"corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each",Dracula
345,motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great,Dracula
345,"awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had",Dracula
345,"found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,",Dracula
345,all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The,Dracula
345,"schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on",Dracula
345,that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many,Dracula
345,storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East,Dracula
345,"Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on,Dracula
345,"the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the",Dracula
345,"""top-hammer"" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant",Dracula
345,"the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as",Dracula
345,"if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow",Dracula
345,"on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard",Dracula
345,hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat,Dracula
345,"tombstones--""thruff-steans"" or ""through-stones,"" as they call them in",Dracula
345,the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff,Dracula
345,"has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed",Dracula
345,intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as",Dracula
345,all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were,Dracula
345,out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern,Dracula
345,"side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the",Dracula
345,"first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring",Dracula
345,"the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the",Dracula
345,"light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and",Dracula
345,"when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at",Dracula
345,once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general,Dracula
345,"curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way",Dracula
345,"round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your",Dracula
345,"correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.",Dracula
345,"When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,",Dracula
345,whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the,Dracula
345,"courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted",Dracula
345,"to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman",Dracula
345,whilst actually lashed to the wheel.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for",Dracula
345,not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened,Dracula
345,"by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between",Dracula
345,"the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it",Dracula
345,"was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by",Dracula
345,"the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but",Dracula
345,the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of,Dracula
345,"the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he",Dracula
345,was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the,Dracula
345,"state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot",Dracula
345,"Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making",Dracula
345,"examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his",Dracula
345,"pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of",Dracula
345,"paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said",Dracula
345,"the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his",Dracula
345,teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some,Dracula
345,"complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot",Dracula
345,claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a,Dracula
345,"derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young",Dracula
345,law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already,Dracula
345,"completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the",Dracula
345,"statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of",Dracula
345,"delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say",Dracula
345,that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where,Dracula
345,he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as,Dracula
345,noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to,Dracula
345,await inquest.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;",Dracula
345,"crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over",Dracula
345,"the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further",Dracula
345,details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into,Dracula
345,harbour in the storm.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Whitby_,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the,Dracula
345,storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It,Dracula
345,"turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the",Dracula
345,"_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a",Dracula
345,small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.,Dracula
345,"This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of",Dracula
345,"7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took",Dracula
345,"possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,",Dracula
345,"acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and",Dracula
345,"paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except",Dracula
345,the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been,Dracula
345,most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with,Dracula
345,"existing regulations. As the matter is to be a ""nine days' wonder,"" they",Dracula
345,are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after,Dracula
345,complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which,Dracula
345,"landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the",Dracula
345,"S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the",Dracula
345,"animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;",Dracula
345,it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it,Dracula
345,"was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still",Dracula
345,hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a,Dracula
345,"possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it",Dracula
345,"is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred",Dracula
345,"mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found",Dracula
345,"dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,",Dracula
345,"and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,",Dracula
345,and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.,Dracula

345,"except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is",Dracula

345,"looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given",Dracula
345,"way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my",Dracula
345,"ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: ""_It_ is here; I know",Dracula
345,"it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,",Dracula

345,"It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the",Dracula

345,"space. Then he went on: ""But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the",Dracula
345,"hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and",Dracula
345,"see. You work the helm."" And, with a warning look and his finger on his",Dracula
345,"lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could",Dracula
345,not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest,Dracula
345,"and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,",Dracula
345,"raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those",Dracula
345,"big boxes: they are invoiced as ""clay,"" and to pull them about is as",Dracula
345,"harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and",Dracula

345,"startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he",Dracula
345,"came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and",Dracula
345,"his face convulsed with fear. ""Save me! save me!"" he cried, and then",Dracula
345,"looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in",Dracula
345,"a steady voice he said: ""You had better come too, captain, before it is",Dracula

345,"from Him, and it is all that is left!"" Before I could say a word, or",Dracula

345,_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most,Dracula
345,"touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin",Dracula
345,was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the,Dracula
345,"churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst",Dracula
345,the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down,Dracula
345,"again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.",Dracula
345,The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on,Dracula
345,it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.,Dracula
345,"She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that",Dracula
345,her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:,Dracula
345,she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if,Dracula
345,"there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional",Dracula
345,cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our,Dracula
345,"seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,",Dracula
345,"fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of",Dracula
345,fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor,Dracula
345,dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so,Dracula
345,sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other,Dracula
345,people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did,Dracula
345,"not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men",Dracula
345,who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.,Dracula
345,"The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw",Dracula
345,"the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would",Dracula
345,"not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few",Dracula
345,"yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then",Dracula
345,"harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a",Dracula
345,"noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs",Dracula
345,bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally,Dracula
345,"the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then",Dracula
345,took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on,Dracula
345,the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the,Dracula
345,stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did,Dracula
345,"not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was",Dracula
345,"in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,",Dracula
345,"to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to",Dracula
345,"touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly",Dracula
345,fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world,Dracula
345,"without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The",Dracula
345,whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead,Dracula
345,"man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the",Dracula
345,"touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all",Dracula
345,afford material for her dreams.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I",Dracula

345,"_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I",Dracula
345,had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely,Dracula
345,"walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some",Dracula
345,"dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,",Dracula
345,and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything,Dracula
345,"except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean",Dracula
345,"and give us a fresh start. We had a capital ""severe tea"" at Robin Hood's",Dracula
345,"Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over",Dracula
345,the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have,Dracula
345,"shocked the ""New Woman"" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless",Dracula
345,"them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,",Dracula
345,and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was,Dracula
345,"really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.",Dracula
345,"The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay",Dracula
345,for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I,Dracula
345,"know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that",Dracula
345,some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new,Dracula
345,"class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be",Dracula
345,"pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and",Dracula
345,"breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and",Dracula
345,"looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her",Dracula
345,"only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.",Dracula
345,"Some of the ""New Women"" writers will some day start an idea that men and",Dracula

345,accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make,Dracula
345,"of it, too! There's some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,",Dracula

345,"I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an",Dracula
345,agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....,Dracula
345,"Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear",Dracula
345,"upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,",Dracula
345,so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed,Dracula
345,was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The,Dracula
345,"door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her",Dracula
345,"mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some",Dracula
345,clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it,Dracula
345,struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her,Dracula
345,"dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.",Dracula
345,"Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. ""Thank God,"" I said",Dracula
345,"to myself, ""she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress."" I ran",Dracula
345,downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in,Dracula
345,"all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear",Dracula
345,chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It,Dracula
345,"was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people",Dracula
345,"of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that",Dracula
345,Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what,Dracula
345,"might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a",Dracula
345,"big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the",Dracula
345,"Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North",Dracula
345,"Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At",Dracula
345,the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to,Dracula
345,"the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy",Dracula
345,"in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,",Dracula
345,"driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of",Dracula
345,light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see,Dracula
345,"nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all",Dracula
345,around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey,Dracula
345,coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as,Dracula
345,"a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually",Dracula
345,"visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for",Dracula
345,"there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a",Dracula
345,"half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too",Dracula
345,"quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost",Dracula
345,immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind,Dracula
345,"the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,",Dracula
345,"whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another",Dracula
345,"glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the",Dracula
345,"fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East",Dracula
345,"Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced",Dracula
345,"that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The",Dracula
345,"time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath",Dracula
345,came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have,Dracula
345,"gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with",Dracula
345,"lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost",Dracula
345,"to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now",Dracula
345,close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There,Dracula
345,"was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the",Dracula
345,"half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, ""Lucy! Lucy!"" and",Dracula
345,"something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face",Dracula
345,"and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the",Dracula
345,"entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and",Dracula
345,"the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in",Dracula
345,"view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly",Dracula
345,that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back,Dracula
345,"of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living",Dracula
345,thing about.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips,Dracula
345,"were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in",Dracula
345,"long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every",Dracula
345,"breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the",Dracula
345,collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so,Dracula
345,"there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I",Dracula
345,"flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,",Dracula
345,"for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,",Dracula
345,"unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to",Dracula
345,"have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her",Dracula
345,throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety,Dracula
345,"and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing",Dracula
345,"became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I",Dracula
345,had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began,Dracula
345,very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she,Dracula
345,"became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing",Dracula
345,"occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other",Dracula
345,"reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,",Dracula
345,till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised,Dracula
345,"to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.",Dracula
345,"Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must",Dracula
345,"have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking",Dracula
345,"unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She",Dracula
345,"trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with",Dracula
345,"me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we",Dracula
345,"passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She",Dracula
345,stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.,Dracula
345,"However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there",Dracula
345,"was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with",Dracula
345,"mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no",Dracula
345,"one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw",Dracula
345,"a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of",Dracula
345,us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as,Dracula
345,"there are here, steep little closes, or ""wynds,"" as they call them in",Dracula
345,Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I,Dracula
345,"should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her",Dracula
345,"health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation",Dracula
345,"in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our",Dracula
345,"feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into",Dracula
345,bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a,Dracula
345,"word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I",Dracula
345,hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her,Dracula
345,"mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,",Dracula
345,"and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,",Dracula
345,"infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do",Dracula
345,"so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to",Dracula
345,"my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping",Dracula
345,soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....,Dracula

345,"_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed",Dracula
345,not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not,Dracula
345,"seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she",Dracula
345,looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to,Dracula
345,"notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might",Dracula
345,"have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have",Dracula
345,"pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are",Dracula
345,"two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress",Dracula
345,"was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she",Dracula
345,"laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it",Dracula
345,"cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.",Dracula

345,"Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the",Dracula
345,"cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for",Dracula
345,I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had,Dracula
345,Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening,Dracula
345,"we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr",Dracula
345,"and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she",Dracula
345,"has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door",Dracula

345,"was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to",Dracula
345,"be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed",Dracula
345,"under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds",Dracula
345,"chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,",Dracula
345,was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of,Dracula
345,"manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me",Dracula
345,and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about,Dracula
345,"Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded",Dracula
345,"somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make",Dracula

345,"before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,",Dracula
345,"still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling",Dracula
345,"aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft",Dracula
345,"effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,",Dracula
345,silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight,Dracula
345,"flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or",Dracula
345,"twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,",Dracula
345,and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back,Dracula
345,"from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.",Dracula
345,She did not stir again all night.,Dracula

345,"_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems",Dracula
345,"to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to",Dracula
345,get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or,Dracula
345,dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for,Dracula
345,"dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and",Dracula
345,"stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low",Dracula
345,"down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was",Dracula
345,"thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe",Dracula
345,"everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and",Dracula
345,suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""His red eyes again! They are just the same."" It was such an odd",Dracula
345,"expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I",Dracula
345,"slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare",Dracula
345,"at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on",Dracula
345,"her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but",Dracula
345,"followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,",Dracula
345,"whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,",Dracula
345,for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like,Dracula
345,burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red,Dracula
345,sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our,Dracula
345,"seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the",Dracula
345,refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I,Dracula
345,"called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself",Dracula
345,"with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she",Dracula
345,was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I,Dracula
345,"said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went",Dracula
345,"early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;",Dracula
345,"I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet",Dracula
345,"sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then",Dracula
345,"bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the",Dracula
345,"Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance",Dracula
345,"up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that",Dracula
345,"perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and",Dracula
345,"waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,",Dracula
345,"the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell",Dracula
345,on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against,Dracula
345,"the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and",Dracula
345,"by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a",Dracula
345,"good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,",Dracula
345,"but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast",Dracula
345,"asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,",Dracula
345,as though to protect it from cold.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the",Dracula
345,door is locked and the window securely fastened.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and",Dracula
345,"there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I",Dracula

345,"Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy",Dracula
345,"is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on",Dracula
345,in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her,Dracula
345,"very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to",Dracula
345,"protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got",Dracula
345,"her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;",Dracula
345,"her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for",Dracula
345,"her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be",Dracula

345,"the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and",Dracula
345,she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping,Dracula
345,as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at,Dracula

345,tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to,Dracula
345,"restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,",Dracula
345,painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the,Dracula
345,window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may,Dracula
345,not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat,Dracula

345,"to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she",Dracula
345,"were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in",Dracula
345,gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence,Dracula
345,"seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I",Dracula
345,"needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this",Dracula
345,"very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with",Dracula
345,the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.",Dracula

345,"look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her",Dracula
345,"habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she",Dracula

345,"knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one",Dracula
345,"could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard",Dracula
345,was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station,Dracula
345,shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that,Dracula

345,_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About,Dracula
345,eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when,Dracula
345,"setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest",Dracula
345,"in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the",Dracula
345,"attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was",Dracula
345,quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he,Dracula
345,would say was:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"     ""I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at",Dracula
345,"     hand.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has,Dracula
345,"seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with",Dracula
345,homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The,Dracula
345,combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself. His,Dracula
345,attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime,Dracula
345,self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him,Dracula
345,"as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that",Dracula
345,he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man,Dracula
345,are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves,Dracula
345,away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created,Dracula
345,"from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,",Dracula
345,if men only knew!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and,Dracula
345,"greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict",Dracula
345,observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his,Dracula
345,"eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it",Dracula
345,the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to,Dracula
345,"know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his",Dracula
345,"bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I",Dracula
345,"would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to",Dracula
345,"lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite",Dracula
345,"his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What?"" I said. ""You don't mean to tell me you don't care about",Dracula
345,"spiders?"" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling",Dracula
345,up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--,Dracula

345,_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had,Dracula
345,"lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the",Dracula
345,"night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield",Dracula
345,had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is,Dracula
345,too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might,Dracula
345,work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.,Dracula
345,"He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his",Dracula
345,"bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His",Dracula
345,attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He,Dracula
345,"ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once",Dracula
345,"sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.",Dracula
345,The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should,Dracula
345,"go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out",Dracula
345,"of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through",Dracula
345,"the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,",Dracula
345,"and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The",Dracula
345,"attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a",Dracula
345,"straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt",Dracula
345,of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our,Dracula
345,grounds from those of the deserted house.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men",Dracula
345,"immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend",Dracula
345,"might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,",Dracula
345,dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield's figure just,Dracula
345,"disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the",Dracula
345,far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old,Dracula
345,"ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some",Dracula
345,"one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest",Dracula
345,"I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of",Dracula
345,"bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping",Dracula
345,"is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not",Dracula
345,"take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to",Dracula
345,him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him,Dracula
345,in. I heard him say:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will",Dracula
345,"reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar",Dracula
345,"off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass",Dracula
345,"me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes,Dracula
345,even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a,Dracula
345,startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.,Dracula
345,"He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I",Dracula
345,never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I,Dracula
345,shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and,Dracula
345,"his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he",Dracula
345,might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any,Dracula
345,rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat,Dracula
345,"that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded",Dracula
345,"room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are",Dracula
345,"more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--,Dracula

345,"all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I",Dracula
345,"feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I",Dracula
345,"knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some",Dracula
345,"nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,",Dracula
345,"oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out",Dracula
345,"of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his",Dracula
345,"face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not",Dracula
345,remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At,Dracula
345,"least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some",Dracula
345,"terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try",Dracula
345,"to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,",Dracula
345,tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I,Dracula
345,"wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,",Dracula
345,and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the,Dracula
345,"secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear",Dracula
345,"them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the",Dracula
345,"next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,",Dracula
345,and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved,Dracula
345,"about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about",Dracula
345,"anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,",Dracula
345,have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes,Dracula
345,"to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can",Dracula
345,treat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my,Dracula
345,poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of,Dracula
345,"_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I",Dracula
345,felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a,Dracula
345,"cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his",Dracula
345,face while he sleeps. He is waking!...,Dracula

345,"I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to",Dracula
345,let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his,Dracula
345,"trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent",Dracula
345,"me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.",Dracula

345,"secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to",Dracula
345,"think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it",Dracula
345,was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain,Dracula

345,"know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my",Dracula

345,_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my,Dracula

345,"worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the",Dracula
345,"clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling",Dracula
345,"asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I",Dracula
345,"did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have",Dracula
345,fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This,Dracula

345,that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady,Dracula
345,"that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with",Dracula
345,her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw,Dracula
345,her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full,Dracula
345,opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship,Dracula
345,makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can,Dracula

345,and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew,Dracula
345,to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no,Dracula
345,"doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.",Dracula
345,"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we",Dracula
345,"got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness",Dracula
345,"amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with",Dracula
345,"me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,",Dracula
345,"for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,",Dracula
345,"however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair",Dracula
345,"with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her",Dracula
345,"high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to",Dracula
345,make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her",Dracula
345,"that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously",Dracula
345,"anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that",Dracula
345,matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for,Dracula
345,"myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see",Dracula
345,"the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the",Dracula
345,"quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord",Dracula
345,"gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a",Dracula
345,"slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured",Dracula
345,a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative,Dracula
345,"analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in",Dracula
345,itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite,Dracula
345,satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a,Dracula
345,"cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something",Dracula
345,mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at,Dracula
345,"times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but",Dracula
345,regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she,Dracula
345,"used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,",Dracula
345,"and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where",Dracula
345,Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not,Dracula
345,"returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I",Dracula
345,"have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of",Dracula
345,"Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the",Dracula
345,"world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things",Dracula
345,"were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your",Dracula
345,"relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to",Dracula
345,"your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for",Dracula
345,"her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal",Dracula
345,"reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his",Dracula
345,"wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows",Dracula
345,what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher,Dracula
345,"and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;",Dracula
345,"and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron",Dracula
345,"nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,",Dracula
345,"self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the",Dracula
345,kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the,Dracula
345,noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and,Dracula
345,"practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I",Dracula

345,"Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not",Dracula

345,return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not,Dracula
345,"be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his",Dracula
345,brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the,Dracula

345,"_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the",Dracula
345,smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a,Dracula

345,"ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was",Dracula
345,"very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him",Dracula

345,"struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick",Dracula
345,look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of,Dracula
345,all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite,Dracula
345,geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into,Dracula
345,"reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation",Dracula
345,"gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--",Dracula

345,"""'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so",Dracula

345,and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can,Dracula

345,"smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all",Dracula

345,He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just,Dracula
345,before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew,Dracula

345,"run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so",Dracula
345,violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five,Dracula

345,"into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The",Dracula

345,"was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture",Dracula
345,by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of,Dracula
345,"padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad",Dracula
345,"conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to",Dracula
345,his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to,Dracula
345,humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the,Dracula
345,"sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a",Dracula
345,"harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a",Dracula
345,"box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find",Dracula
345,"a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any",Dracula
345,clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not,Dracula
345,"rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of",Dracula
345,"far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do",Dracula

345,"his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in",Dracula
345,the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky,Dracula
345,"beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows",Dracula
345,and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul,Dracula
345,"water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone",Dracula
345,"building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart",Dracula
345,"to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from",Dracula
345,his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less,Dracula
345,"frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an",Dracula
345,"inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual",Dracula
345,"recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up",Dracula
345,quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to,Dracula
345,"hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight",Dracula
345,over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his,Dracula
345,"fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut",Dracula
345,"the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised",Dracula
345,"me, so I asked him: ""Are you not going to keep flies any more?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No,"" said he; ""I am sick of all that rubbish!"" He certainly is a",Dracula

345,with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch,Dracula
345,"as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,",Dracula
345,too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why,Dracula
345,you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge,Dracula
345,"in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it",Dracula
345,"and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here."" He",Dracula
345,"touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself",Dracula
345,"the same way. ""I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall",Dracula
345,"unfold to you.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why not now?"" I asked. ""It may do some good; we may arrive at some",Dracula
345,"decision."" He stopped and looked at me, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has",Dracula
345,"ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine",Dracula
345,"has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the",Dracula
345,"ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,",Dracula
345,and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the,Dracula
345,"time comes.'"" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply",Dracula
345,"he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as",Dracula
345,"he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: ""The good husbandman tell",Dracula
345,"you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the",Dracula
345,good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for,Dracula
345,"the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of",Dracula
345,"the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,",Dracula
345,"and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,",Dracula
345,"there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell."" He broke",Dracula
345,"off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very",Dracula
345,gravely:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more",Dracula
345,"full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and",Dracula
345,"I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that",Dracula
345,"knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.",Dracula
345,"Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this",Dracula
345,"case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such",Dracula
345,interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the,Dracula
345,"beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too",Dracula
345,"small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.",Dracula
345,Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We,Dracula
345,"learn from failure, not from success!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely",Dracula
345,"more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a",Dracula
345,"bag in which were many instruments and drugs, ""the ghastly paraphernalia",Dracula
345,"of our beneficial trade,"" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the",Dracula
345,"equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,",Dracula
345,"Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I",Dracula
345,expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained,Dracula
345,"that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case",Dracula
345,"where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some",Dracula
345,"cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her",Dracula
345,daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is,Dracula
345,something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an,Dracula
345,envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that,Dracula
345,which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered,Dracula
345,"selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice",Dracula
345,"of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have",Dracula
345,knowledge of.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down",Dracula
345,a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness,Dracula
345,"more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that",Dracula
345,I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were,Dracula
345,"shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I",Dracula
345,"was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the",Dracula
345,"red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of",Dracula
345,her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or,Dracula
345,"hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged",Dracula
345,"till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not",Dracula
345,"seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The",Dracula
345,instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to,Dracula
345,"the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and",Dracula
345,"closed the door. ""My God!"" he said; ""this is dreadful. There is no time",Dracula
345,to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's,Dracula
345,action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is,Dracula
345,"it you or me?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at",Dracula
345,the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the,Dracula
345,"door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in",Dracula
345,an eager whisper:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and",Dracula
345,"have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for",Dracula
345,"myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,",Dracula
345,"sir, for coming."" When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had",Dracula
345,"been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in",Dracula
345,his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which,Dracula
345,"seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to",Dracula
345,him gravely as he held out his hand:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is",Dracula
345,"bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that."" For he",Dracula
345,"suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. ""You are to",Dracula
345,"help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your",Dracula
345,"best help.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What can I do?"" asked Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me, and I shall do it. My",Dracula
345,"life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for",Dracula
345,"her."" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old",Dracula
345,knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What shall I do?"" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril",Dracula
345,"quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. ""Come!""",Dracula
345,"he said. ""You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than",Dracula
345,"me, better than my friend John."" Arthur looked bewildered, and the",Dracula
345,Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have",Dracula
345,or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform,Dracula
345,what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to,Dracula
345,"the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is",Dracula
345,"the more young and strong than me""--here Arthur took my hand and wrung",Dracula
345,"it hard in silence--""but, now you are here, you are more good than us,",Dracula
345,"old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not",Dracula
345,"so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!"" Arthur turned to him",Dracula
345,and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would",Dracula
345,"understand----""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good boy!"" said Van Helsing. ""In the not-so-far-off you will be happy",Dracula
345,that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You,Dracula
345,"shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you",Dracula
345,must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with,Dracula
345,"her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.,Dracula
345,"Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not",Dracula
345,"asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke",Dracula
345,to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid,Dracula
345,"them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and",Dracula
345,"coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good",Dracula
345,"child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes."" She had made",Dracula
345,the effort with success.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked",Dracula
345,the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to,Dracula
345,"flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest",Dracula
345,its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was,Dracula
345,"satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his",Dracula
345,"coat. Then he added: ""You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring",Dracula
345,"over the table. Friend John, help to me!"" So neither of us looked whilst",Dracula
345,he bent over her.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing turning to me, said:",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not",Dracula
345,"defibrinate it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the",Dracula
345,operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come,Dracula
345,"back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy",Dracula
345,of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow,Dracula
345,"anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he",Dracula
345,was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must,Dracula
345,have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.,Dracula
345,"But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with",Dracula
345,his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own,Dracula
345,"heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: ""Do not stir an instant.",Dracula
345,"It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her."" When all was over I",Dracula
345,could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his,Dracula
345,"arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the",Dracula
345,man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have",Dracula
345,"presently."" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the",Dracula
345,pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band,Dracula
345,"which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old",Dracula
345,"diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,",Dracula
345,"and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I",Dracula
345,could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's,Dracula
345,"ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to",Dracula
345,"me, saying: ""Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port",Dracula
345,"wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep",Dracula
345,"much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to",Dracula
345,"his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,",Dracula
345,that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways,Dracula
345,"the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you",Dracula
345,can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell,Dracula
345,her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you,Dracula
345,"have done. Good-bye.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,",Dracula
345,but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her,Dracula
345,"breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.",Dracula
345,The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a,Dracula
345,whisper:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What do you make of that mark on her throat?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What do you make of it?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I have not examined it yet,"" I answered, and then and there proceeded",Dracula
345,to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two,Dracula
345,"punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of",Dracula
345,"disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some",Dracula
345,"trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it",Dracula
345,"was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned",Dracula
345,"the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed",Dracula
345,would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must,Dracula
345,have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well?"" said Van Helsing.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well,"" said I, ""I can make nothing of it."" The Professor stood up. ""I",Dracula
345,"must go back to Amsterdam to-night,"" he said. ""There are books and",Dracula
345,"things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you",Dracula
345,"must not let your sight pass from her.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Shall I have a nurse?"" I asked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that",Dracula
345,"she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all",Dracula
345,"the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as",Dracula
345,"possible. And then we may begin.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""May begin?"" I said. ""What on earth do you mean?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We shall see!"" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment",Dracula
345,later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held,Dracula
345,up:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you",Dracula
345,"shall not sleep easy hereafter!""",Dracula

345,_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself,Dracula
345,"off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being",Dracula
345,"from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,",Dracula
345,"and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the",Dracula
345,absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra,Dracula
345,that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she,Dracula
345,"almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed",Dracula
345,"strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made",Dracula
345,preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the,Dracula
345,"night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by",Dracula
345,"the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me",Dracula
345,gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed,Dracula
345,"sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together",Dracula
345,"and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort",Dracula
345,and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she,Dracula
345,"did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You do not want to go to sleep?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No; I am afraid.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All",Dracula
345,"this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and",Dracula
345,"I can promise that nothing will happen.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, I can trust you!"" I seized the opportunity, and said: ""I promise",Dracula
345,"you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will",Dracula
345,"sleep!"" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank",Dracula
345,"back, asleep.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on",Dracula
345,"in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were",Dracula
345,"slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a",Dracula
345,"pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad",Dracula
345,dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took",Dracula
345,"myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short",Dracula
345,"wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result",Dracula
345,"of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all",Dracula
345,day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my,Dracula
345,zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the,Dracula
345,past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst,Dracula
345,"I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as",Dracula
345,"it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the",Dracula
345,night mail and would join me early in the morning.,Dracula

345,"Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my",Dracula
345,brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral,Dracula
345,exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands,Dracula
345,with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well",Dracula
345,"again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who",Dracula

345,"supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I",Dracula
345,"made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than",Dracula
345,"excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next",Dracula
345,"her own, where a cozy fire was burning. ""Now,"" she said, ""you must stay",Dracula
345,here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the,Dracula
345,sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to,Dracula
345,bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I,Dracula
345,"shall call out, and you can come to me at once."" I could not but",Dracula
345,"acquiesce, for I was ""dog-tired,"" and could not have sat up had I tried.",Dracula

345,"As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I",Dracula

345,"his exclamation of horror, ""Gott in Himmel!"" needed no enforcement from",Dracula

345,"without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did",Dracula
345,"not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no",Dracula
345,"matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing",Dracula
345,"held up a warning finger. ""Do not stir,"" he said, ""but I fear that with",Dracula
345,"growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much",Dracula
345,danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection,Dracula
345,"of morphia."" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his",Dracula
345,"intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge",Dracula
345,subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride,Dracula
345,that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid,Dracula
345,"cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to",Dracula
345,feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Professor watched me critically. ""That will do,"" he said. ""Already?""",Dracula
345,"I remonstrated. ""You took a great deal more from Art."" To which he",Dracula
345,smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her",Dracula
345,"and for others; and the present will suffice.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied",Dracula
345,"digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his",Dracula
345,"leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by",Dracula
345,"he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for",Dracula
345,"myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half",Dracula
345,whispered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up",Dracula
345,"unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and",Dracula
345,"enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and",Dracula
345,"rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I",Dracula
345,"had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I",Dracula
345,"felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at",Dracula
345,"what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over",Dracula
345,"and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how",Dracula
345,she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to,Dracula
345,"show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,",Dracula
345,"sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little",Dracula
345,"punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their",Dracula
345,edges--tiny though they were.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and",Dracula
345,"strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing",Dracula
345,"had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict",Dracula
345,injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his,Dracula
345,"voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything",Dracula
345,had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother,Dracula
345,"came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but",Dracula
345,said to me gratefully:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really",Dracula
345,must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale,Dracula
345,yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you,Dracula
345,"do!"" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,",Dracula
345,for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted,Dracula
345,drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned,Dracula
345,"imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my",Dracula
345,"lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:",Dracula
345,"""Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I",Dracula
345,"stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and",Dracula
345,"I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave",Dracula
345,"reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think",Dracula
345,"even the most not-probable. Good-night.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of",Dracula
345,them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and,Dracula
345,when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit,Dracula
345,"up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the ""foreign",Dracula
345,"gentleman."" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because",Dracula
345,"I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that",Dracula
345,their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen,Dracula
345,similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a,Dracula
345,late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting,Dracula
345,for sleep. It is coming.,Dracula

345,_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van,Dracula
345,"Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had",Dracula
345,"arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it",Dracula
345,"with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of",Dracula
345,white flowers.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""These are for you, Miss Lucy,"" he said.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines."" Here",Dracula
345,"Lucy made a wry face. ""Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or",Dracula
345,"in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall",Dracula
345,point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing,Dracula
345,"so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,",Dracula
345,"that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but",Dracula
345,"you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and",Dracula
345,"hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the",Dracula
345,"lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters",Dracula
345,"of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought",Dracula
345,"for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling",Dracula
345,"them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and",Dracula
345,half-disgust:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,",Dracula
345,"these flowers are only common garlic.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his",Dracula
345,iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;",Dracula
345,"and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of",Dracula
345,"others if not for your own."" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might",Dracula
345,"well be, he went on more gently: ""Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear",Dracula
345,me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so,Dracula
345,"common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the",Dracula
345,wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so,Dracula
345,"inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;",Dracula
345,and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait,Dracula
345,"for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall",Dracula
345,"help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,",Dracula
345,where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.,Dracula
345,"I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's",Dracula
345,actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia,Dracula
345,that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them,Dracula
345,"securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over",Dracula
345,"the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get",Dracula
345,in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed,Dracula
345,"all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round",Dracula
345,"the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and",Dracula
345,presently I said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but",Dracula
345,"this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he",Dracula
345,"would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Perhaps I am!"" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which",Dracula
345,Lucy was to wear round her neck.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she",Dracula
345,was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her,Dracula
345,neck. The last words he said to her were:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do",Dracula
345,"not to-night open the window or the door.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,"your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such",Dracula
345,"friends?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,"much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,",Dracula
345,"and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early",Dracula

345,"more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights",Dracula
345,"before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must",Dracula

345,_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.,Dracula
345,Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He,Dracula
345,"positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been",Dracula
345,"right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread",Dracula
345,"being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not",Dracula
345,"mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I",Dracula
345,"have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,",Dracula
345,"or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has",Dracula
345,"for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no",Dracula
345,"dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings",Dracula
345,"nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,",Dracula

345,"_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,",Dracula
345,up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The,Dracula
345,"Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at,Dracula
345,eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the,Dracula
345,fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's,Dracula
345,"annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,",Dracula
345,but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met,Dracula
345,Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early,Dracula
345,riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still",Dracula
345,"asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I",Dracula
345,"should disturb her."" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He",Dracula
345,"rubbed his hands together, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,"" to",Dracula
345,which she answered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this",Dracula
345,"morning is due in part to me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""How you do mean, ma'am?"" asked the Professor.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into",Dracula
345,her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did,Dracula
345,not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those,Dracula
345,"horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually",Dracula
345,a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be,Dracula
345,"too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away",Dracula
345,and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be,Dracula
345,"pleased with her, I am sure.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As",Dracula
345,"she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen",Dracula
345,grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady,Dracula
345,"was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;",Dracula
345,he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into,Dracula
345,"her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and",Dracula
345,"forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He",Dracula
345,"raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat",Dracula
345,"his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,",Dracula
345,"and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs",Dracula
345,that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised,Dracula
345,"his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. ""God! God!",Dracula
345,"God!"" he said. ""What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that",Dracula
345,"we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the",Dracula
345,"pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor",Dracula
345,"mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such",Dracula
345,"thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we",Dracula
345,"must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are",Dracula
345,"beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!"" Suddenly he",Dracula
345,"jumped to his feet. ""Come,"" he said, ""come, we must see and act. Devils",Dracula
345,"or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him",Dracula
345,"all the same."" He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we",Dracula
345,went up to Lucy's room.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.",Dracula
345,This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same,Dracula
345,"awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and",Dracula
345,infinite pity.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""As I expected,"" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which",Dracula
345,"meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then",Dracula
345,began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another,Dracula
345,operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the,Dracula
345,"necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a",Dracula
345,"warning hand. ""No!"" he said. ""To-day you must operate. I shall provide.",Dracula
345,"You are weakened already."" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled",Dracula
345,up his shirt-sleeve.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to,Dracula
345,"the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I",Dracula
345,watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must,Dracula
345,not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the,Dracula
345,"flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour",Dracula
345,was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case,Dracula
345,"himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would",Dracula
345,send me word when to come.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and",Dracula
345,seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life,Dracula

345,_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong,Dracula
345,again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some,Dracula
345,"long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and",Dracula
345,feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim,Dracula
345,"half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness",Dracula
345,in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress,Dracula
345,"more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to",Dracula
345,"life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,",Dracula
345,"however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems",Dracula
345,to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my,Dracula
345,"wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed",Dracula
345,"so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and",Dracula
345,commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now,Dracula
345,without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown,Dracula
345,"quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from",Dracula
345,"Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a",Dracula
345,day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left,Dracula
345,"alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our",Dracula
345,"friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for",Dracula
345,last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first",Dracula

345,young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem,Dracula
345,away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the,Dracula
345,bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that,Dracula
345,"day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook",Dracula
345,"nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He",Dracula
345,"had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,",Dracula
345,for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give",Dracula
345,"'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind",Dracula
345,"of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they",Dracula
345,"wouldn't like me,' 'e says.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a",Dracula

345,"""Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they",Dracula
345,"lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears",Dracula
345,"same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put",Dracula

345,"I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling",Dracula
345,stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore,Dracula
345,"turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it,Dracula

345,well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a,Dracula
345,personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor",Dracula

345,"penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine",Dracula

345,_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my,Dracula
345,"books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,",Dracula
345,"had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in",Dracula
345,"rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was",Dracula
345,"thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord",Dracula
345,into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's,Dracula
345,"pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,",Dracula
345,"as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was",Dracula
345,"too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my",Dracula
345,balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.,Dracula
345,"Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was",Dracula
345,"sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a",Dracula
345,little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not,Dracula
345,"intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,",Dracula
345,keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the,Dracula
345,"attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment",Dracula
345,positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking,Dracula
345,"up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was",Dracula
345,"easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite",Dracula

345,"I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that",Dracula
345,"sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I",Dracula
345,"know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in",Dracula
345,the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have,Dracula
345,"called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me",Dracula
345,"the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep",Dracula
345,"would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be",Dracula
345,"alone, I opened my door and called out: ""Is there anybody there?"" There",Dracula
345,"was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.",Dracula
345,"Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but",Dracula
345,"more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could",Dracula
345,"see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its",Dracula
345,"wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined",Dracula
345,"not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;",Dracula
345,"seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She",Dracula
345,said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all",Dracula
345,"right.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in",Dracula
345,"and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did",Dracula
345,"not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while",Dracula
345,"and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in",Dracula
345,"hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was",Dracula
345,"startled and a little frightened, and cried out: ""What is that?"" I tried",Dracula
345,"to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could",Dracula
345,hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was,Dracula
345,"the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a",Dracula
345,"crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.",Dracula
345,"The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the",Dracula
345,"aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey",Dracula
345,"wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting",Dracula
345,"posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst",Dracula
345,"other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing",Dracula
345,"insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a",Dracula
345,"second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange",Dracula
345,and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck,Dracula
345,"with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a",Dracula
345,moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my,Dracula
345,"eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole",Dracula
345,myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken,Dracula
345,"window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that",Dracula
345,travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to,Dracula
345,"stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,",Dracula
345,which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to,Dracula
345,beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered",Dracula
345,"consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the",Dracula
345,"dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,",Dracula
345,"seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and",Dracula
345,"stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the",Dracula
345,nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort,Dracula
345,"me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear",Dracula
345,"their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they",Dracula
345,"came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay",Dracula
345,"over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the",Dracula
345,"broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my",Dracula
345,"dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I",Dracula
345,had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them,Dracula
345,to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew,Dracula
345,"open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went",Dracula
345,in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear,Dracula
345,mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing,Dracula
345,"had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would",Dracula
345,have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that,Dracula
345,"the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went",Dracula
345,to the dining-room to look for them.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless,Dracula
345,"on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table",Dracula
345,"half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,",Dracula
345,"and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the",Dracula
345,"sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for",Dracula
345,her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back,Dracula
345,"in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for",Dracula
345,"the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I",Dracula
345,"dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the",Dracula
345,broken window.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from",Dracula
345,"the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God",Dracula
345,"shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,",Dracula
345,where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother,Dracula

345,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.,Dracula
345,"Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently",Dracula
345,"and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her",Dracula
345,"mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,",Dracula
345,"finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed",Dracula
345,the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an,Dracula
345,"hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but",Dracula
345,"more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only",Dracula
345,"the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this",Dracula
345,desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing,Dracula
345,"tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too",Dracula
345,"late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of",Dracula
345,"danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;",Dracula
345,and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry,Dracula
345,anywhere.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and,Dracula
345,"locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the",Dracula
345,rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the,Dracula
345,"gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.",Dracula
345,"When he saw me, he gasped out:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you",Dracula
345,"not get my telegram?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his,Dracula
345,"telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,",Dracula
345,and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and,Dracula
345,raised his hat as he said solemnly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!"" With his usual",Dracula
345,"recuperative energy, he went on: ""Come. If there be no way open to get",Dracula
345,"in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen",Dracula
345,"window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and",Dracula
345,"handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I",Dracula
345,attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then,Dracula
345,"with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and",Dracula
345,"opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There",Dracula
345,"was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at",Dracula
345,"hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,",Dracula
345,"dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four",Dracula
345,"servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,",Dracula
345,for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the,Dracula
345,room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at,Dracula
345,"each other, and as we moved away he said: ""We can attend to them later.""",Dracula
345,Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the,Dracula
345,"door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white",Dracula
345,"faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the",Dracula
345,room.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her",Dracula
345,"mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white",Dracula
345,"sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the",Dracula
345,"broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror",Dracula
345,"fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more",Dracula
345,drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her,Dracula
345,"mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds",Dracula
345,"which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.",Dracula
345,"Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching",Dracula
345,"poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who",Dracula
345,"listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste",Dracula
345,"it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found",Dracula
345,"on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I",Dracula
345,"fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,",Dracula
345,"but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another",Dracula
345,"occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her",Dracula
345,hands. He said to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.",Dracula
345,"Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them",Dracula
345,get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as,Dracula
345,that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything,Dracula
345,"more.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the",Dracula
345,"women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently",Dracula
345,"affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her",Dracula
345,"sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to",Dracula
345,them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with,Dracula
345,"them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life",Dracula
345,"was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice",Dracula
345,"Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad",Dracula
345,"as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and",Dracula
345,"boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We",Dracula
345,got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst,Dracula
345,we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One,Dracula
345,"of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then",Dracula
345,she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come,Dracula
345,with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he,Dracula
345,"must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,",Dracula
345,"and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly,Dracula
345,"earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,",Dracula
345,and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not,Dracula
345,"understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade",Dracula
345,"away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon."" He went",Dracula
345,"on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to,Dracula
345,be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the,Dracula
345,"stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's",Dracula
345,"face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in",Dracula
345,a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The first gain is ours! Check to the King!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid",Dracula
345,her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed,Dracula
345,that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was,Dracula
345,"still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had",Dracula
345,ever seen her.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her",Dracula
345,"and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me",Dracula
345,out of the room.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" he said as we descended the",Dracula
345,"stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he",Dracula
345,"closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but",Dracula
345,"the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of",Dracula
345,death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly,Dracula
345,"observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light",Dracula
345,enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved,Dracula
345,by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about,Dracula
345,"something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have",Dracula
345,"another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life",Dracula
345,won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am,Dracula
345,"exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have",Dracula
345,courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his,Dracula
345,"veins for her?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What's the matter with me, anyhow?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought",Dracula
345,"relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a",Dracula
345,"glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: ""Quincey Morris!"" and",Dracula
345,rushed towards him with outstretched hands.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What brought you here?"" I cried as our hands met.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I guess Art is the cause.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He handed me a telegram:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.",Dracula
345,Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.,Dracula
345,"Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell",Dracula
345,"me what to do.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in",Dracula
345,the eyes as he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in",Dracula
345,"trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against",Dracula
345,"us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart,Dracula
345,to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it,Dracula
345,"told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her",Dracula
345,"veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other",Dracula
345,occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see,Dracula
345,"and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with",Dracula
345,good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched,Dracula
345,"whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids",Dracula
345,to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down,Dracula
345,"after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good",Dracula
345,"breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where",Dracula
345,"Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or",Dracula
345,"two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was",Dracula
345,thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look,Dracula
345,"of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.",Dracula
345,"He handed me the paper saying only: ""It dropped from Lucy's breast when",Dracula
345,"we carried her to the bath.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause",Dracula
345,"asked him: ""In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,",Dracula
345,"mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?"" I was so bewildered that I",Dracula
345,did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the,Dracula
345,"paper, saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know",Dracula
345,and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what,Dracula
345,"is it that you came to me to say?"" This brought me back to fact, and I",Dracula
345,was all myself again.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act",Dracula
345,"properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have",Dracula
345,"to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we",Dracula
345,"had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you",Dracula
345,"know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra",Dracula
345,"had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us",Dracula
345,"fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the",Dracula
345,"registrar and go on to the undertaker.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be",Dracula
345,"sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that",Dracula
345,"love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old",Dracula
345,"man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the",Dracula
345,"more for it! Now go.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him",Dracula
345,"that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now",Dracula
345,going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him,Dracula
345,"where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to",Dracula
345,"ourselves?"" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about",Dracula
345,"the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in",Dracula
345,the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him,Dracula
345,"as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still",Dracula
345,"sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her",Dracula
345,"side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he",Dracula
345,expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.,Dracula
345,"So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where",Dracula
345,"the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or",Dracula
345,"rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said",Dracula
345,to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no",Dracula
345,right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl,Dracula
345,"and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't",Dracula
345,help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong,Dracula
345,with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see,Dracula
345,"that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have",Dracula
345,"_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.",Dracula
345,"Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man",Dracula
345,must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is,Dracula
345,"no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that",Dracula
345,"so?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That's so,"" I said, and he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did",Dracula
345,"to-day. Is not that so?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That's so.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his",Dracula
345,own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick,Dracula
345,since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass,Dracula
345,all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at,Dracula
345,"her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there",Dracula
345,"wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a",Dracula
345,"bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without",Dracula
345,"betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?"" As he spoke",Dracula
345,the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense,Dracula
345,"regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible",Dracula
345,mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very,Dracula
345,"heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a",Dracula
345,"royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before",Dracula
345,"answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the",Dracula
345,"Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed",Dracula
345,"so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered",Dracula
345,"in the same phrase: ""That's so.""",Dracula

345,"frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.",Dracula

345,"what to do, and I'll do it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel",Dracula
345,"in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing",Dracula
345,had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had,Dracula
345,"come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,",Dracula
345,"and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her",Dracula
345,poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that,Dracula
345,meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried,Dracula
345,"what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but",Dracula
345,"she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for",Dracula
345,a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with,Dracula
345,"her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell",Dracula
345,into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she,Dracula
345,took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped,Dracula
345,"over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on",Dracula
345,"with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her",Dracula
345,hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering,Dracula
345,"the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as",Dracula
345,"if in thought, but he said nothing.",Dracula

345,"to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and",Dracula
345,"I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment",Dracula
345,"unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew",Dracula
345,that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's",Dracula
345,"strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little",Dracula
345,nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she,Dracula
345,"slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between",Dracula
345,"sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more",Dracula
345,"haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale",Dracula
345,"gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and",Dracula
345,sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently,Dracula
345,"changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying",Dracula
345,"one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.",Dracula
345,Quincey went off to meet him at the station.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full",Dracula
345,"and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more",Dracula

345,"with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,",Dracula
345,"the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had",Dracula
345,"grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible",Dracula
345,"were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a",Dracula
345,"stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she",Dracula

345,made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to,Dracula

345,"make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a",Dracula
345,"well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had",Dracula
345,"ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most",Dracula
345,"genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he",Dracula
345,"blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe",Dracula
345,"that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to",Dracula
345,"say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an",Dracula
345,hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the,Dracula
345,"window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the",Dracula
345,"attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent",Dracula
345,on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which,Dracula
345,"had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden",Dracula
345,"boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the",Dracula
345,"face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the",Dracula
345,"patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to",Dracula
345,knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the,Dracula
345,moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other,Dracula
345,fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his,Dracula
345,"heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but",Dracula
345,"seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and",Dracula
345,"fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others",Dracula
345,were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we,Dracula
345,"began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat",Dracula
345,"on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!",Dracula
345,they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and,Dracula
345,all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable,Dracula
345,difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded,Dracula
345,"room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set",Dracula
345,it all right; and he is going on well.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for",Dracula
345,"damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their",Dracula
345,"threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for",Dracula
345,the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it,Dracula
345,had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and,Dracula
345,raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of,Dracula
345,him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary,Dracula
345,state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of,Dracula
345,their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their,Dracula
345,labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their,Dracula
345,"drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and",Dracula
345,"with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore",Dracula
345,that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of,Dracula
345,meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their,Dracula
345,"names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as",Dracula

345,_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry,Dracula
345,"to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world",Dracula
345,"and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard",Dracula
345,this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has,Dracula
345,been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother,Dracula
345,"and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to,Dracula
345,"go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him",Dracula
345,"that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not",Dracula
345,"all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed",Dracula
345,"to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. ""Come, my child,"" he said;",Dracula
345,"""come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much",Dracula
345,"mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You",Dracula
345,must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.,Dracula
345,"Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two",Dracula
345,"sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will",Dracula
345,"be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we",Dracula
345,"sleep."" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's",Dracula
345,"face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay",Dracula
345,"quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it",Dracula
345,"should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,",Dracula
345,"as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the",Dracula
345,"window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk",Dracula
345,"handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of",Dracula
345,"the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and",Dracula
345,"her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her",Dracula
345,"teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they",Dracula
345,"had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the",Dracula
345,"canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,",Dracula
345,and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort,Dracula
345,"of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,",Dracula
345,"and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,",Dracula
345,"and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled",Dracula
345,"round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now",Dracula
345,"and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,",Dracula
345,"I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic",Dracula
345,"flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat",Dracula
345,watching her.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.",Dracula
345,"She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with",Dracula
345,her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto,Dracula
345,so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she,Dracula
345,became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was,Dracula
345,"certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the",Dracula
345,"stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she",Dracula
345,waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any,Dracula
345,"mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many",Dracula
345,spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen,Dracula
345,"into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face",Dracula
345,"I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a",Dracula
345,"sharp whisper: ""Draw up the blind; I want light!"" Then he bent down,",Dracula
345,"and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He",Dracula
345,removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As,Dracula
345,"he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, ""Mein",Dracula
345,"Gott!"" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,",Dracula
345,and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face",Dracula
345,at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark",Dracula
345,"me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and",Dracula
345,"let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but",Dracula
345,when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters,Dracula
345,"he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy",Dracula
345,"was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van",Dracula
345,Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his,Dracula
345,"hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,",Dracula
345,"perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders",Dracula
345,"shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. ""Come,"" I",Dracula
345,"said, ""my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best",Dracula
345,"and easiest for her.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with",Dracula
345,"his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making",Dracula
345,everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's,Dracula
345,"hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we",Dracula
345,"came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered",Dracula
345,softly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"" He was stooping to",Dracula
345,"kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. ""No,"" he whispered, ""not",Dracula
345,"yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,",Dracula
345,with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then,Dracula
345,"gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her",Dracula
345,"breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in,Dracula
345,"the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale",Dracula
345,"gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a",Dracula
345,"sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which",Dracula
345,"were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,",Dracula
345,such as I had never heard from her lips:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!"" Arthur bent",Dracula
345,"eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,",Dracula
345,"had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by",Dracula
345,"the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which",Dracula
345,"I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost",Dracula
345,across the room.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not for your life!"" he said; ""not for your living soul and hers!"" And",Dracula
345,he stood between them like a lion at bay.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do,Dracula
345,or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised,Dracula
345,"the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as",Dracula
345,of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed,Dracula
345,"together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and",Dracula
345,"putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown",Dracula
345,"one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. ""My true friend,"" she said, in a",Dracula
345,"faint voice, but with untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his! Oh,",Dracula
345,"guard him, and give me peace!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I swear it!"" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his",Dracula
345,"hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said",Dracula
345,"to him: ""Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the",Dracula
345,"forehead, and only once.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took",Dracula
345,"Arthur's arm, and drew him away.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it",Dracula
345,ceased.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is all over,"" said Van Helsing. ""She is dead!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he",Dracula
345,"sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that",Dracula
345,nearly broke me down to see.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and",Dracula
345,his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.,Dracula
345,"Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had",Dracula
345,recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their,Dracula
345,"deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working",Dracula
345,"of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as",Dracula
345,might be.,Dracula

345,Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from,Dracula
345,the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives,Dracula
345,at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his,Dracula
345,"father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been",Dracula
345,"bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon",Dracula
345,"ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's",Dracula
345,"papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a",Dracula
345,"foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and",Dracula
345,so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But",Dracula
345,"this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the",Dracula
345,coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such,Dracula
345,"as this.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been,Dracula
345,"in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.",Dracula
345,"Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch",Dracula
345,"here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself",Dracula
345,search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found",Dracula
345,the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to,Dracula
345,him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions,Dracula
345,regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the,Dracula

345,saying:--,Dracula

345,,Dracula

345,"have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a",Dracula
345,"diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say",Dracula
345,"nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with",Dracula

345,,Dracula

345,"for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had,Dracula
345,"certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small",Dracula
345,"_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,",Dracula
345,and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the,Dracula
345,winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and,Dracula
345,"turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall",Dracula
345,wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's,Dracula
345,"loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,",Dracula
345,"instead of leaving traces of ""decay's effacing fingers,"" had but",Dracula
345,"restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes",Dracula
345,that I was looking at a corpse.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and",Dracula
345,"there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: ""Remain till I",Dracula
345,"return,"" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic",Dracula
345,"from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and",Dracula
345,placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he,Dracula
345,"took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and",Dracula
345,"placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we",Dracula
345,came away.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the",Dracula

345,"that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you",Dracula
345,"shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant",Dracula
345,"things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet",Dracula
345,did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but,Dracula
345,man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you,Dracula
345,"send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay",Dracula
345,"horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was",Dracula
345,dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw,Dracula
345,"how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so",Dracula
345,"weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not",Dracula
345,"hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many",Dracula
345,"years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so",Dracula
345,"strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend",Dracula
345,"John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is",Dracula
345,"not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no",Dracula
345,"trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,",Dracula
345,"oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!"" He paused a",Dracula
345,"moment and went on solemnly: ""Friend John, there are strange and",Dracula
345,"terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to",Dracula
345,"a good end. Will you not have faith in me?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,",Dracula
345,and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without,Dracula
345,"moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had",Dracula
345,"her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy",Dracula
345,"lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful",Dracula
345,to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl,Dracula
345,putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch,Dracula
345,"alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay",Dracula
345,might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.",Dracula
345,"Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial",Dracula
345,"and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all",Dracula
345,cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for,Dracula
345,"some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs",Dracula
345,"in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain",Dracula
345,"entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct",Dracula
345,"issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,",Dracula
345,"real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had",Dracula
345,told us so much he went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and",Dracula
345,pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either,Dracula
345,penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial,Dracula
345,"alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into",Dracula
345,"collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out",Dracula
345,"her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were",Dracula
345,"right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should",Dracula
345,"have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.",Dracula
345,"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of",Dracula
345,disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her,Dracula
345,wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come,Dracula
345,"into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her",Dracula
345,"mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no",Dracula
345,will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been,Dracula
345,"treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,",Dracula
345,"though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the",Dracula
345,"inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just",Dracula
345,"rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure",Dracula
345,"you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which",Dracula
345,"he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an",Dracula
345,object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and",Dracula
345,"see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to",Dracula
345,"us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile",Dracula
345,"criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so",Dracula
345,a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in,Dracula
345,"very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,",Dracula
345,"true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and",Dracula
345,there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at,Dracula
345,"once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,",Dracula
345,"explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be",Dracula
345,less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_,Dracula
345,quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and,Dracula
345,exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them,Dracula
345,"the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings",Dracula
345,as we could avoid were saved.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart,Dracula
345,manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his,Dracula
345,"much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly",Dracula
345,"attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a",Dracula
345,"bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he",Dracula
345,was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some,Dracula
345,"constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to",Dracula
345,"bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I",Dracula
345,"felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and",Dracula
345,"led me in, saying huskily:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was",Dracula
345,no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to,Dracula
345,"thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and",Dracula
345,"laid his head on my breast, crying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me",Dracula
345,"all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much,Dracula
345,"expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the",Dracula
345,"shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's",Dracula
345,"heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said",Dracula
345,softly to him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come and look at her.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.",Dracula
345,God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her,Dracula
345,"loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he",Dracula
345,"fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At",Dracula
345,"last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jack, is she really dead?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt",Dracula
345,that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than,Dracula
345,I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became,Dracula
345,softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was,Dracula
345,especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged,Dracula
345,"suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after",Dracula
345,kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and,Dracula
345,"long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the",Dracula
345,coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his,Dracula
345,"and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,",Dracula
345,fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said",Dracula
345,good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men,Dracula
345,to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he,Dracula
345,"came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he",Dracula
345,replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make",Dracula
345,the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but,Dracula
345,when we had lit our cigars he said--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Lord----""; but Arthur interrupted him:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:",Dracula
345,I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so,Dracula
345,"recent.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The Professor answered very sweetly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you",Dracula
345,"'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as",Dracula
345,"Arthur.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Call me what you will,"" he said. ""I hope I may always have the title of",Dracula
345,a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for,Dracula
345,"your goodness to my poor dear."" He paused a moment, and went on: ""I know",Dracula
345,that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was,Dracula
345,"rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember""--the",Dracula
345,"Professor nodded--""you must forgive me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He answered with a grave kindness:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such",Dracula
345,violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you,Dracula
345,"cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be",Dracula
345,more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may,Dracula
345,not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust,Dracula
345,"shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as",Dracula
345,though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from,Dracula
345,"first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her",Dracula
345,"dear sake to whom I swore to protect.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And, indeed, indeed, sir,"" said Arthur warmly, ""I shall in all ways",Dracula
345,"trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are",Dracula
345,"Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to",Dracula
345,"speak, and finally said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""May I ask you something now?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Certainly.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No, poor dear; I never thought of it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I",Dracula
345,want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and,Dracula
345,"letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,",Dracula
345,"be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them",Dracula
345,"before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch",Dracula
345,them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep,Dracula
345,"them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them",Dracula
345,safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back,Dracula
345,"to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I",Dracula
345,am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you,Dracula
345,"with questions till the time comes.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be",Dracula
345,"all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of",Dracula
345,"all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we",Dracula

345,Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me,Dracula
345,about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what,Dracula
345,unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up,Dracula
345,again with an exercise anyhow....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves,Dracula
345,"and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his",Dracula
345,"London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the",Dracula
345,President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in,Dracula
345,"hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.",Dracula
345,"Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so",Dracula
345,"we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was",Dracula
345,sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think,Dracula
345,of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.,Dracula
345,"Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days",Dracula
345,"before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on",Dracula
345,for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the,Dracula
345,"pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he",Dracula
345,"was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't",Dracula
345,care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful,Dracula
345,"girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,",Dracula
345,"when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said",Dracula
345,"under his breath: ""My God!"" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I",Dracula
345,fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him,Dracula
345,"quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and",Dracula
345,"half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and",Dracula
345,"black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty",Dracula
345,"girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,",Dracula
345,and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was,Dracula
345,"hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all",Dracula
345,"the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.",Dracula
345,"Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I",Dracula
345,"feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked",Dracula
345,"Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that",Dracula
345,"I knew as much about it as he did: ""Do you see who it is?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No, dear,"" I said; ""I don't know him; who is it?"" His answer seemed to",Dracula
345,"shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was",Dracula
345,"to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is the man himself!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly,Dracula
345,terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to,Dracula
345,support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of,Dracula
345,"the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove",Dracula
345,"off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage",Dracula
345,"moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a",Dracula
345,"hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be",Dracula
345,"so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!"" He was",Dracula
345,distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the,Dracula
345,"subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him",Dracula
345,"away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little",Dracula
345,"further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was",Dracula
345,"a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.",Dracula
345,"After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he",Dracula
345,"went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it",Dracula
345,"was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty",Dracula
345,"minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.",Dracula
345,"Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere."" He had evidently forgotten",Dracula
345,"all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that",Dracula
345,this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into,Dracula
345,forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must,Dracula
345,"not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow",Dracula
345,"learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I",Dracula

345,"_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has",Dracula
345,taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe,Dracula
345,in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any,Dracula
345,of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America,Dracula
345,"can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world",Dracula
345,"indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his",Dracula
345,"journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns",Dracula
345,to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can,Dracula
345,"only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says",Dracula
345,he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old,Dracula
345,fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his,Dracula
345,"iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting",Dracula
345,"some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were",Dracula
345,"standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in",Dracula
345,the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I,Dracula
345,could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was,Dracula
345,saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married,Dracula
345,and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of,Dracula
345,"the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went",Dracula
345,"away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The",Dracula
345,moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of,Dracula
345,"hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted",Dracula
345,that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very,Dracula
345,"terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down",Dracula
345,"the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,",Dracula

345,"does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the",Dracula
345,circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in,Dracula
345,manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew,Dracula
345,"grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.",Dracula
345,"His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and",Dracula

345,"I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other",Dracula
345,sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very,Dracula
345,grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her,Dracula
345,"coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood",Dracula
345,"from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of",Dracula
345,"the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his",Dracula

345,"a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and",Dracula
345,troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the,Dracula
345,"tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and",Dracula
345,tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he,Dracula
345,"make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that",Dracula
345,"he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn",Dracula
345,"tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,",Dracula
345,"like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a,Dracula
345,series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what,Dracula
345,"was known to the writers of headlines as ""The Kensington Horror,"" or",Dracula
345,"""The Stabbing Woman,"" or ""The Woman in Black."" During the past two or",Dracula
345,three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from,Dracula
345,home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all,Dracula
345,these cases the children were too young to give any properly,Dracula
345,"intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses",Dracula
345,"is that they had been with a ""bloofer lady."" It has always been late in",Dracula
345,"the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the",Dracula
345,children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is,Dracula
345,"generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed",Dracula
345,"gave as his reason for being away that a ""bloofer lady"" had asked him to",Dracula
345,"come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as",Dracula
345,occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the,Dracula
345,little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A,Dracula
345,correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to,Dracula
345,"be the ""bloofer lady"" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists",Dracula
345,"might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the",Dracula
345,reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general,Dracula
345,"principles of human nature that the ""bloofer lady"" should be the popular",Dracula
345,rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says,Dracula
345,that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of,Dracula
345,these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine,Dracula
345,themselves--to be.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of",Dracula

345,slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be,Dracula
345,"made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance",Dracula
345,"individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has",Dracula
345,a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been,Dracula

345,_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that,Dracula
345,"he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible",Dracula
345,"things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the",Dracula
345,"responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,",Dracula
345,and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his,Dracula
345,advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon,Dracula
345,"him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch",Dracula
345,"at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,",Dracula
345,and lock myself up in my room and read it....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_24 September_.--I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terrible,Dracula
345,"record of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,",Dracula
345,whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth,Dracula
345,"in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those",Dracula
345,"terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall",Dracula
345,"never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man",Dracula
345,we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I,Dracula
345,suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some,Dracula
345,train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our,Dracula
345,"wedding-day he said: ""Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to",Dracula
345,"the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane."" There seems to be",Dracula
345,through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was,Dracula
345,"coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his",Dracula
345,teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must,Dracula
345,not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter,Dracula
345,this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other,Dracula
345,"eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,",Dracula
345,"poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let",Dracula
345,him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets,Dracula
345,"over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him",Dracula

345,"Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am",Dracula
345,deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find,Dracula
345,"some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you",Dracula

345,"attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about",Dracula
345,her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her,Dracula
345,"sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real",Dracula
345,truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my,Dracula
345,imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of,Dracula
345,"course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that",Dracula
345,awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten,Dracula
345,in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him,Dracula
345,"of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about",Dracula
345,"it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may",Dracula

345,"Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may",Dracula
345,not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even,Dracula
345,a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its,Dracula
345,consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did,Dracula
345,"not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt",Dracula
345,"which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter",Dracula
345,"which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more",Dracula
345,satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a,Dracula
345,good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.,Dracula
345,"Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after",Dracula
345,Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a,Dracula
345,noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;,Dracula
345,"and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good",Dracula
345,end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's,Dracula

345,It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à,Dracula

345,"strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and",Dracula
345,a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise,Dracula
345,of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the,Dracula
345,"head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,",Dracula
345,"clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile",Dracula
345,"mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive",Dracula
345,"nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the",Dracula
345,"mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost",Dracula
345,straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;,Dracula
345,"such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,",Dracula
345,"but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set",Dracula

345,"good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that",Dracula

345,"he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of",Dracula
345,"thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I",Dracula
345,"wanted to follow him, so I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so",Dracula
345,that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in,Dracula
345,"my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an",Dracula
345,"idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping",Dracula
345,from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without,Dracula
345,"knowing where I am going.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That is good image,"" he said. ""Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is",Dracula
345,"this: I want you to believe.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""To believe what?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once",Dracula
345,of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to,Dracula
345,"believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.",Dracula
345,"He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of",Dracula
345,"truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway",Dracula
345,"truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value",Dracula
345,him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in,Dracula
345,"the universe.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the",Dracula
345,receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read,Dracula
345,"your lesson aright?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now",Dracula
345,"that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to",Dracula
345,understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's,Dracula
345,"throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I suppose so."" He stood up and said solemnly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,",Dracula
345,"far, far worse.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?"" I cried.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life,Dracula
345,struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to,Dracula
345,him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?"" He raised his head and looked at me, and",Dracula
345,"somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. ""Would I were!"" he",Dracula
345,"said. ""Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my",Dracula
345,"friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell",Dracula
345,you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all,Dracula
345,"my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,",Dracula
345,"now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a",Dracula
345,"fearful death? Ah no!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Forgive me,"" said I. He went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,",Dracula
345,for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not,Dracula
345,expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract,Dracula
345,"truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always",Dracula
345,believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a,Dracula
345,"concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove",Dracula
345,"it. Dare you come with me?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron,Dracula
345,"excepted from the category, jealousy.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"    ""And prove the very truth he most abhorred.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock",Dracula
345,"to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;",Dracula
345,"at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet",Dracula
345,"very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,",Dracula
345,"I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child",Dracula
345,"in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers",Dracula
345,"say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were",Dracula
345,"in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he",Dracula
345,"will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we",Dracula
345,"wish to learn. And then----""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And then?"" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. ""And then we",Dracula
345,"spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is",Dracula
345,the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to,Dracula
345,"Arthur."" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful",Dracula
345,"ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what",Dracula
345,"heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was",Dracula
345,passing....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and",Dracula
345,altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its,Dracula
345,"throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the",Dracula
345,"similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,",Dracula
345,and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he,Dracula
345,"attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some",Dracula
345,"animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think",Dracula
345,that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern,Dracula
345,"heights of London. ""Out of so many harmless ones,"" he said, ""there may",Dracula
345,be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some,Dracula
345,"sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from",Dracula
345,"the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred",Dracula
345,"there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago",Dracula
345,"a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a",Dracula
345,"week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the",Dracula
345,Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare,Dracula
345,"came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even",Dracula
345,"this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he",Dracula
345,"might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted",Dracula
345,"to play with the 'bloofer lady.'""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I hope,"" said Van Helsing, ""that when you are sending the child home",Dracula
345,you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies,Dracula
345,to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another,Dracula
345,"night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will",Dracula
345,"not let it away for some days?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not",Dracula
345,"healed.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and",Dracula
345,the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it,Dracula
345,"was, he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek",Dracula
345,"somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We dined at ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a little crowd of",Dracula
345,bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we,Dracula
345,"started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps",Dracula
345,made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual,Dracula
345,"radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he",Dracula
345,"went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to",Dracula
345,"locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at",Dracula
345,last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse,Dracula
345,police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of,Dracula
345,"the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for",Dracula
345,"it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found",Dracula
345,"the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,",Dracula
345,"and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to",Dracula
345,"precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the",Dracula
345,courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My,Dracula
345,"companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after",Dracula
345,"carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,",Dracula
345,one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he,Dracula
345,"fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,",Dracula
345,"proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed",Dracula
345,"with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some",Dracula
345,"days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites",Dracula
345,turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the,Dracula
345,beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured,Dracula
345,"stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished",Dracula
345,"brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a",Dracula
345,"candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been",Dracula
345,imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was,Dracula
345,not the only thing which could pass away.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so,Dracula
345,"that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm",Dracula
345,"dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he",Dracula
345,"made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took",Dracula
345,out a turnscrew.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What are you going to do?"" I asked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced."" Straightway he began",Dracula
345,"taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the",Dracula
345,casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed,Dracula
345,to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have,Dracula
345,stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took,Dracula
345,"hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: ""You shall see,"" and again",Dracula
345,"fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew",Dracula
345,"through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he",Dracula
345,"made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of",Dracula
345,the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We,Dracula
345,"doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to",Dracula
345,"such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never",Dracula
345,stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of,Dracula
345,"the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the",Dracula
345,"edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the",Dracula
345,"coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to",Dracula
345,look.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,",Dracula
345,"and so emboldened to proceed in his task. ""Are you satisfied now, friend",Dracula
345,"John?"" he asked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as,Dracula
345,I answered him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only",Dracula
345,"proves one thing.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And what is that, friend John?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That it is not there.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That is good logic,"" he said, ""so far as it goes. But how do you--how",Dracula
345,"can you--account for it not being there?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Perhaps a body-snatcher,"" I suggested. ""Some of the undertaker's people",Dracula
345,"may have stolen it."" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was",Dracula
345,"the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. ""Ah",Dracula
345,"well!"" he said, ""we must have more proof. Come with me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed",Dracula
345,"them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the",Dracula
345,"bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and",Dracula
345,"locked it. He handed me the key, saying: ""Will you keep it? You had",Dracula
345,"better be assured."" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am",Dracula
345,"bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. ""A key is nothing,"" I said;",Dracula
345,"""there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock",Dracula
345,"of that kind."" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he",Dracula
345,told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at,Dracula
345,"the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark",Dracula
345,figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my,Dracula
345,sight.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant,Dracula
345,"clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and",Dracula
345,"unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand",Dracula
345,and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly,Dracula
345,"observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had",Dracula
345,"a dreary, miserable time.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white",Dracula
345,"streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard",Dracula
345,farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the,Dracula
345,"Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I",Dracula
345,"too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I",Dracula
345,"stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an",Dracula
345,"early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered",Dracula
345,"juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim",Dracula
345,figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden,Dracula
345,"by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the",Dracula
345,"rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and",Dracula
345,"coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When",Dracula
345,"he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Are you satisfied now?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No,"" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you not see the child?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?"" I",Dracula
345,asked.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We shall see,"" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way",Dracula
345,"out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of",Dracula
345,"trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was",Dracula
345,without a scratch or scar of any kind.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Was I right?"" I asked triumphantly.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We were just in time,"" said the Professor thankfully.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted",Dracula
345,about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to,Dracula
345,"give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should",Dracula
345,have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.,Dracula
345,"So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we",Dracula
345,"heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find",Dracula
345,it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out,Dracula
345,well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy,Dracula
345,"tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until",Dracula
345,he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation,Dracula
345,"of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a",Dracula
345,"cab near the ""Spaniards,"" and drove to town.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'",Dracula
345,"sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall",Dracula
345,go with him on another expedition.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable,Dracula
345,"opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,",Dracula
345,and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily,Dracula
345,"away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw",Dracula
345,the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till,Dracula
345,morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not,Dracula
345,want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the,Dracula
345,"reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of",Dracula
345,place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were,Dracula
345,"incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.",Dracula
345,"Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead",Dracula
345,"nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to",Dracula
345,"open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own",Dracula
345,"eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,",Dracula
345,"and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,",Dracula
345,"no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again",Dracula
345,courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as,Dracula
345,"last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine",Dracula
345,"streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.",Dracula
345,He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock,Dracula
345,of surprise and dismay shot through me.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her",Dracula
345,"funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I",Dracula
345,"could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than",Dracula
345,before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Is this a juggle?"" I said to him.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Are you convinced now?"" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke",Dracula
345,"he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the",Dracula
345,dead lips and showed the white teeth.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""See,"" he went on, ""see, they are even sharper than before. With this",Dracula
345,"and this""--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below",Dracula
345,"it--""the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend",Dracula
345,"John?"" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not",Dracula
345,"accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to",Dracula
345,"argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""She may have been placed here since last night.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Indeed? That is so, and by whom?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I do not know. Some one has done it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not",Dracula
345,"look so."" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not",Dracula
345,"seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor",Dracula
345,"triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising",Dracula
345,"the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and",Dracula
345,examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is",Dracula
345,some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire,Dracula
345,"when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know",Dracula
345,"that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could",Dracula
345,"he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she",Dracula
345,"is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when",Dracula
345,"the Un-Dead sleep at home""--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of",Dracula
345,"his arm to designate what to a vampire was ""home""--""their face show what",Dracula
345,"they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to",Dracula
345,"the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so",Dracula
345,"it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."" This turned my blood",Dracula
345,"cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's",Dracula
345,"theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the",Dracula
345,"idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in",Dracula
345,"my face, for he said almost joyously:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, you believe now?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I answered: ""Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to",Dracula
345,"accept. How will you do this bloody work?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall",Dracula
345,"drive a stake through her body."" It made me shudder to think of so",Dracula
345,mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling,Dracula
345,"was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to",Dracula
345,"shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing",Dracula
345,"called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,",Dracula
345,or all objective?,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as",Dracula
345,if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a,Dracula
345,"snap, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I",Dracula
345,"did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is",Dracula
345,"to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are",Dracula
345,thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is,Dracula
345,"simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act",Dracula
345,now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to,Dracula
345,"want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the",Dracula

345,"beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know",Dracula
345,"of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,",Dracula
345,"and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect",Dracula
345,"Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I",Dracula
345,took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me,Dracula
345,because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say,Dracula
345,good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea,Dracula
345,this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have,Dracula
345,"killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that",Dracula
345,have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet,Dracula
345,he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will,Dracula
345,"sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint",Dracula
345,"his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he",Dracula
345,"will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,",Dracula
345,"an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since",Dracula
345,"I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he",Dracula
345,"must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,",Dracula
345,must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to,Dracula
345,him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is,Dracula
345,"made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see",Dracula
345,"that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this",Dracula

345,"the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from",Dracula
345,"you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can",Dracula

345,"then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the,Dracula
345,churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams,Dracula
345,of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across,Dracula
345,"the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly",Dracula
345,in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked,Dracula
345,"well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so",Dracula
345,sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it,Dracula
345,that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant,Dracula
345,"to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural",Dracula
345,"hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by",Dracula
345,"entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.",Dracula
345,He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped,Dracula
345,forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that",Dracula
345,"coffin?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It was."" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me."" He",Dracula
345,took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur,Dracula
345,"looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped",Dracula
345,"forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,",Dracula
345,"at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,",Dracula
345,"the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away",Dracula
345,"again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and",Dracula
345,recoiled.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The coffin was empty!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by,Dracula
345,Quincey Morris:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask",Dracula
345,such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a,Dracula
345,doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.,Dracula
345,"Is this your doing?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor",Dracula
345,touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and,Dracula
345,"I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which",Dracula
345,"was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and",Dracula
345,saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in,Dracula
345,"day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,",Dracula
345,"and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came",Dracula
345,"here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here",Dracula
345,"all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable",Dracula
345,"that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,",Dracula
345,"which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last",Dracula
345,"night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my",Dracula
345,garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But,Dracula
345,bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me,Dracula
345,"outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.",Dracula
345,"So""--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--""now to the outside.""",Dracula
345,"He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the",Dracula
345,door behind him.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of,Dracula
345,"that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing",Dracula
345,gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and,Dracula
345,passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was,Dracula
345,"to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how",Dracula
345,"humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to",Dracula
345,hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each,Dracula
345,"in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I",Dracula
345,"could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the",Dracula
345,"mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to",Dracula
345,throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey,Dracula
345,"Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and",Dracula
345,"accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to",Dracula
345,"stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of",Dracula
345,"tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a",Dracula
345,definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like,Dracula
345,"thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white",Dracula
345,"napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like",Dracula
345,dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the,Dracula
345,"mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin",Dracula
345,"strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its",Dracula
345,"setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,",Dracula
345,asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near,Dracula
345,"also, as they too were curious. He answered:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?"" asked Quincey.",Dracula
345,"""Great Scott! Is this a game?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What is that which you are using?"" This time the question was by",Dracula
345,Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence."" It was an",Dracula
345,"answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually",Dracula
345,"that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a",Dracula
345,"purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was",Dracula
345,impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places,Dracula
345,"assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any",Dracula
345,"one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself",Dracula
345,"been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,",Dracula
345,"who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink",Dracula
345,"within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or",Dracula
345,"yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree",Dracula
345,or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so,Dracula
345,mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a,Dracula
345,woeful presage through the night.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the",Dracula
345,"Professor a keen ""S-s-s-s!"" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews",Dracula
345,"we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something",Dracula
345,"dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of",Dracula
345,moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling,Dracula
345,"prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.",Dracula
345,"We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a",Dracula
345,"fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a",Dracula
345,"child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We",Dracula
345,"were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as",Dracula
345,"he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the",Dracula
345,white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see,Dracula
345,"clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,",Dracula
345,"and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of",Dracula
345,"Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was",Dracula
345,"turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous",Dracula
345,"wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we",Dracula
345,all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the,Dracula
345,tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the,Dracula
345,concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips,Dracula
345,"were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her",Dracula
345,chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had",Dracula
345,"not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her,Dracula
345,"shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives",Dracula
345,when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form,Dracula
345,"and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of",Dracula
345,"the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love",Dracula
345,"passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have",Dracula
345,"done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy",Dracula
345,"light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,",Dracula
345,"how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to",Dracula
345,"the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had",Dracula
345,"clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls",Dracula
345,"over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There",Dracula
345,was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when,Dracula
345,she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell,Dracula
345,back and hid his face in his hands.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,",Dracula
345,said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are",Dracula
345,"hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the,Dracula
345,tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us,Dracula
345,"who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under",Dracula
345,"a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She",Dracula
345,"was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between",Dracula
345,"them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a",Dracula
345,"suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter",Dracula
345,the tomb.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if",Dracula
345,"arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was",Dracula
345,"shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no",Dracula
345,quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled,Dracula
345,"malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by",Dracula
345,"mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw",Dracula
345,"out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of",Dracula
345,"the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,",Dracula
345,"blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of",Dracula
345,the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could,Dracula
345,kill--we saw it at that moment.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained",Dracula
345,between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of,Dracula
345,entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he",Dracula
345,answered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like",Dracula
345,"this ever any more;"" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I",Dracula
345,"simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the",Dracula
345,click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close,Dracula
345,"to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred",Dracula
345,emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified,Dracula
345,"amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal",Dracula
345,"body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice",Dracula
345,where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of,Dracula
345,relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty,Dracula
345,to the edges of the door.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When this was done, he lifted the child and said:",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a",Dracula
345,"funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The",Dracula
345,"friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock",Dracula
345,the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of,Dracula
345,"to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow",Dracula
345,night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find,Dracula
345,"him, as on the other night; and then to home."" Coming close to Arthur,",Dracula
345,he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look",Dracula
345,"back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter",Dracula
345,"waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have",Dracula
345,"passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn",Dracula
345,"overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other",Dracula
345,"on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all",Dracula
345,slept with more or less reality of sleep.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,",Dracula
345,"Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to",Dracula
345,notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of,Dracula
345,"course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of",Dracula
345,"us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and",Dracula
345,"strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the",Dracula
345,gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief,Dracula
345,"that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to",Dracula
345,"ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a",Dracula
345,"long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of",Dracula
345,fair weight.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up,Dracula
345,"the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the",Dracula
345,"Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it",Dracula
345,"behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also",Dracula
345,"two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own",Dracula
345,"ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work",Dracula
345,by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur,Dracula
345,trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its,Dracula
345,"death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but",Dracula
345,loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her,Dracula
345,soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently,Dracula
345,he said to Van Helsing:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her",Dracula
345,"as she was, and is.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,",Dracula
345,"the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to",Dracula
345,"see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a",Dracula
345,"devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual",Dracula
345,"methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and",Dracula
345,placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some,Dracula
345,"plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in",Dracula
345,"a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue",Dracula
345,"flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a",Dracula
345,"round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about",Dracula
345,"three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and",Dracula
345,"was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such",Dracula
345,as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To,Dracula
345,"me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and",Dracula
345,"bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was",Dracula
345,"to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their",Dracula
345,"courage, and remained silent and quiet.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and",Dracula
345,experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers,Dracula
345,"of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the",Dracula
345,"curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age",Dracula
345,adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that,Dracula
345,"die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey",Dracula
345,"on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the",Dracula
345,"ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met",Dracula
345,"that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night",Dracula
345,"when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,",Dracula
345,"have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would",Dracula
345,all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.,Dracula
345,The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those,Dracula
345,children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if,Dracula
345,"she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her",Dracula
345,power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that,Dracula
345,"so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny",Dracula
345,"wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays",Dracula
345,"unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when",Dracula
345,"this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor",Dracula
345,lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by,Dracula
345,"night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she",Dracula
345,"shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will",Dracula
345,be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.,Dracula
345,To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better,Dracula
345,right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the,Dracula
345,night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it,Dracula
345,was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would,Dracula
345,"herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be",Dracula
345,"such a one amongst us?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite",Dracula
345,kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore,Dracula
345,"Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and",Dracula
345,"said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as",Dracula
345,snow:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me",Dracula
345,"what I am to do, and I shall not falter!"" Van Helsing laid a hand on his",Dracula
345,"shoulder, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be",Dracula
345,driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in,Dracula
345,"that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more",Dracula
345,than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though,Dracula
345,you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only,Dracula
345,"think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for",Dracula
345,"you all the time.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Go on,"" said Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me what I am to do.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the",Dracula
345,"heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for",Dracula
345,"the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall",Dracula
345,"follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that",Dracula
345,"we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on",Dracula
345,action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened,Dracula
345,"his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we",Dracula
345,"could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could",Dracula
345,see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech",Dracula
345,came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted,Dracula
345,in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the,Dracula
345,"lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur",Dracula
345,never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm,Dracula
345,"rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst",Dracula
345,the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His,Dracula
345,"face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it",Dracula
345,gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little,Dracula
345,vault.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the",Dracula
345,"teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The",Dracula
345,terrible task was over.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had,Dracula
345,"we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,",Dracula
345,and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain,Dracula
345,on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human,Dracula
345,considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few,Dracula
345,minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the,Dracula
345,"coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one",Dracula
345,"to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had",Dracula
345,"been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,",Dracula
345,strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of,Dracula
345,horror that lay upon it.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded",Dracula
345,and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a,Dracula
345,"privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in",Dracula
345,"her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that",Dracula
345,"there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and",Dracula
345,"pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth",Dracula
345,to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like,Dracula
345,sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and,Dracula
345,symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to",Dracula
345,him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand,Dracula
345,"in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,",Dracula
345,"and me peace."" He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying",Dracula
345,"his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood",Dracula
345,unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as",Dracula
345,"she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning",Dracula
345,devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is,Dracula
345,"the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the",Dracula
345,"tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point",Dracula
345,of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with,Dracula
345,"garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,",Dracula
345,"and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked",Dracula
345,the door he gave the key to Arthur.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it",Dracula
345,seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was,Dracula
345,"gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves",Dracula
345,"on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing",Dracula
345,to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author,Dracula
345,of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can,Dracula
345,"follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in",Dracula
345,"it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all",Dracula
345,"of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do",Dracula
345,"we not promise to go on to the bitter end?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the",Dracula
345,Professor as we moved off:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of",Dracula
345,"the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you",Dracula
345,know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans,Dracula
345,"unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult",Dracula
345,"about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall",Dracula
345,return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I,Dracula
345,"shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.",Dracula
345,Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of,Dracula

345,"them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your",Dracula
345,"faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What",Dracula
345,"is here told,"" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of",Dracula
345,"papers as he spoke, ""may be the beginning of the end to you and me and",Dracula

345,"any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have",Dracula
345,kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we,Dracula
345,"shall go through all these together when we meet."" He then made ready",Dracula

345,"after a quick glance, said: ""Dr. Seward, is it not?""",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it",Dracula

345,"""Your diary?"" I asked him in surprise.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes,"" he answered. ""I keep it in this."" As he spoke he laid his hand on",Dracula
345,"the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Certainly,"" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train",Dracula
345,"for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The fact is,"" he began awkwardly, ""I only keep my diary in it; and as",Dracula
345,"it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that",Dracula
345,"is, I mean----"" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his",Dracula
345,embarrassment:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;",Dracula
345,"for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very",Dracula
345,"dear to me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why not?"" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.",Dracula
345,"Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.",Dracula
345,At length he stammered out:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the",Dracula
345,"diary."" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said",Dracula
345,"with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté",Dracula
345,"of a child: ""That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!"" I could",Dracula
345,"not but smile, at which he grimaced. ""I gave myself away that time!"" he",Dracula
345,"said. ""But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months",Dracula
345,"past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular",Dracula
345,"part of it in case I wanted to look it up?"" By this time my mind was",Dracula
345,made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have,Dracula
345,"something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and",Dracula
345,I said boldly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my",Dracula
345,"typewriter."" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible",Dracula
345,"story!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,",Dracula
345,"and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or",Dracula
345,"some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on",Dracula
345,"the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,",Dracula
345,followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You do not know me,"" I said. ""When you have read those papers--my own",Dracula
345,"diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me",Dracula
345,better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in,Dracula
345,"this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not",Dracula
345,"expect you to trust me so far.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about,Dracula
345,"him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in",Dracula
345,"order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and",Dracula
345,said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.",Dracula
345,But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long,Dracula
345,ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make,Dracula
345,the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the,Dracula
345,"first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify",Dracula
345,you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the,Dracula
345,"meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better",Dracula
345,"able to understand certain things."" He carried the phonograph himself up",Dracula
345,to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan,Dracula
345,Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without,Dracula
345,thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce,Dracula
345,"dinner, so I said: ""She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,"" and",Dracula
345,"I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when",Dracula
345,"she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were",Dracula
345,flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had,Dracula
345,"cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and",Dracula
345,"now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went",Dracula
345,straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I greatly fear I have distressed you.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, no, not distressed me,"" she replied, ""but I have been more touched",Dracula
345,"than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is",Dracula
345,"cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.",Dracula
345,It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them,Dracula
345,"spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the",Dracula

345,"I did.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No one need ever know, shall ever know,"" I said in a low voice. She",Dracula

345,before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all,Dracula
345,the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the,Dracula
345,cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;,Dracula
345,but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark,Dracula

345,_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He,Dracula
345,"brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He",Dracula
345,"placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I",Dracula
345,"could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case",Dracula
345,"I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his",Dracula
345,"back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I",Dracula
345,put the forked metal to my ears and listened.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was",Dracula
345,"done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a",Dracula
345,fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a,Dracula
345,"horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a",Dracula
345,"cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored",Dracula
345,"me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all",Dracula
345,"the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy",Dracula
345,"was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without",Dracula
345,"making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I",Dracula
345,had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have,Dracula
345,"believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my",Dracula
345,difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my,Dracula
345,"typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing",Dracula
345,when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when,Dracula
345,"he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,",Dracula
345,"and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item",Dracula
345,"put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that",Dracula
345,Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him,Dracula
345,"when they come."" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I",Dracula
345,began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used,Dracula
345,"manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with",Dracula
345,"all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about",Dracula
345,his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he,Dracula
345,"came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely",Dracula
345,whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of,Dracula
345,good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I,Dracula
345,remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's,Dracula
345,perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at,Dracula
345,"Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the",Dracula
345,"files of ""The Westminster Gazette"" and ""The Pall Mall Gazette,"" and took",Dracula
345,"them to my room. I remember how much ""The Dailygraph"" and ""The Whitby",Dracula
345,"Gazette,"" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the",Dracula
345,"terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look",Dracula

345,"_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,",Dracula
345,and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They,Dracula
345,are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in,Dracula
345,chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got,Dracula
345,the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the,Dracula
345,carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's,Dracula
345,typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it,Dracula
345,is....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be,Dracula
345,     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues,Dracula
345,     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters,Dracula
345,"     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,",Dracula
345,     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!,Dracula
345,"     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again",Dracula
345,     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be,Dracula
345,     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the,Dracula
345,"     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of",Dracula
345,"     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,",Dracula
345,     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing,Dracula
345,     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have,Dracula
345,     found the dates otherwise....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands,Dracula
345,"     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any",Dracula
345,     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of,Dracula
345,"     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own",Dracula
345,"     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my",Dracula
345,"     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite",Dracula
345,"     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I",Dracula
345,     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of,Dracula
345,"     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a",Dracula
345,"     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All",Dracula
345,     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the,Dracula
345,     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that,Dracula
345,     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?,Dracula
345,"     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the",Dracula
345,"     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of ""master."" This",Dracula
345,"     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came",Dracula
345,     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it,Dracula
345,"     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,",Dracula
345,     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so,Dracula

345,"thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such",Dracula
345,inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo,Dracula
345,"of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal",Dracula
345,"with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and",Dracula
345,"brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must",Dracula
345,"stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:",Dracula
345,"give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all",Dracula
345,"knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had",Dracula
345,ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.,Dracula
345,It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had,Dracula
345,seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.,Dracula
345,"Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and",Dracula
345,with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which,Dracula
345,might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried,Dracula
345,"out. To use an Americanism, he had ""taken no chances,"" and the absolute",Dracula
345,"accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the",Dracula
345,"logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:",Dracula
345,"""Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.""",Dracula
345,"Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of",Dracula
345,these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could,Dracula
345,"give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs",Dracula
345,officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the,Dracula
345,"strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local",Dracula
345,"tradition; but no one could add to the simple description ""Fifty cases",Dracula
345,"of common earth."" I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in",Dracula
345,communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their,Dracula
345,"tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that",Dracula
345,"the boxes were ""main and mortal heavy,"" and that shifting them was dry",Dracula
345,work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any,Dracula
345,"gentleman ""such-like as yourself, squire,"" to show some sort of",Dracula
345,appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider,Dracula
345,that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had,Dracula
345,"elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care",Dracula
345,"before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of",Dracula
345,reproach.,Dracula

345,_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to,Dracula
345,"his old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I",Dracula
345,arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of,Dracula
345,"the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper",Dracula
345,"officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original",Dracula
345,invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here,Dracula
345,"limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was",Dracula
345,compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met",Dracula
345,with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their,Dracula
345,"day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross",Dracula
345,"office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming",Dracula
345,"were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending",Dracula
345,also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the,Dracula
345,delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing,Dracula
345,exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the,Dracula
345,"written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected",Dracula
345,"almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent",Dracula
345,"thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,",Dracula

345,Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at,Dracula

345,detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a,Dracula

345,brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of,Dracula
345,"course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing, too, has been quite ""blowing my trumpet,"" as Mr. Morris",Dracula

345,came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post,Dracula
345,them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that,Dracula
345,they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear,Dracula
345,"to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I",Dracula
345,"could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband",Dracula
345,"and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.",Dracula
345,I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got,Dracula
345,his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I nodded, and he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and",Dracula
345,"kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all",Dracula
345,I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have,Dracula
345,had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble,Dracula
345,"to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--""",Dracula
345,Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear,Dracula
345,"the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid",Dracula
345,"a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the",Dracula
345,room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man,Dracula
345,free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or,Dracula
345,emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when,Dracula
345,Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and,Dracula
345,gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I,Dracula
345,"hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it",Dracula
345,afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I,Dracula
345,"_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I",Dracula
345,could see that his heart was breaking:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to",Dracula
345,"her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let",Dracula
345,me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have,Dracula
345,"had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can",Dracula
345,"help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for",Dracula
345,"Lucy's sake?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed,Dracula
345,to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a,Dracula
345,"vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat",Dracula
345,his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat,Dracula
345,"down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite",Dracula
345,"pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his",Dracula
345,"head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with",Dracula
345,emotion.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above,Dracula
345,smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big,Dracula
345,"sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby",Dracula
345,"that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he",Dracula
345,were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an",Dracula
345,"apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for",Dracula
345,days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been,Dracula
345,"unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of",Dracula
345,"sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with",Dracula
345,"whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was",Dracula
345,"surrounded, he could speak freely. ""I know now how I suffered,"" he said,",Dracula
345,"as he dried his eyes, ""but I do not know even yet--and none other can",Dracula
345,ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall,Dracula
345,"know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful",Dracula
345,"now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be",Dracula
345,"like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""For dear Lucy's sake,"" I said as we clasped hands. ""Ay, and for your",Dracula
345,"own sake,"" he added, ""for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth",Dracula
345,"the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring",Dracula
345,"to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call",Dracula
345,in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the,Dracula
345,"sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you",Dracula
345,"will let me know."" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that",Dracula
345,"I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I promise.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.,Dracula
345,"He turned as he heard my footsteps. ""How is Art?"" he said. Then noticing",Dracula
345,"my red eyes, he went on: ""Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor",Dracula
345,old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in,Dracula
345,"trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the,Dracula
345,"manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise",Dracula
345,how much I knew; so I said to him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me",Dracula
345,"be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You",Dracula
345,"will know, later on, why I speak."" He saw that I was in earnest, and",Dracula
345,"stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed",Dracula
345,"but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I",Dracula
345,"bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a",Dracula
345,momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long",Dracula
345,"as ever you live!"" Then he went into the study to his friend.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Little girl!""--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he",Dracula
345,proved himself a friend!,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming",Dracula
345,"and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript",Dracula
345,of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife,Dracula
345,had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the,Dracula
345,"carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave",Dracula
345,"us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I",Dracula
345,"have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had",Dracula
345,"finished, Mrs. Harker said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.",Dracula
345,Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary,Dracula
345,"interests me so much!"" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I",Dracula
345,"could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so",Dracula
345,"I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a",Dracula
345,"lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: ""Why?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,"" I",Dracula
345,"answered. ""Oh, very well,"" he said; ""let her come in, by all means; but",Dracula
345,"just wait a minute till I tidy up the place."" His method of tidying was",Dracula
345,peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes,Dracula
345,"before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was",Dracula
345,"jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting",Dracula
345,"task, he said cheerfully: ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down on the",Dracula
345,"edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that",Dracula
345,he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might,Dracula
345,have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just,Dracula
345,"before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I",Dracula
345,could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She,Dracula
345,came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command,Dracula
345,the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad,Dracula
345,"people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and",Dracula
345,held out her hand.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,"" said she. ""You see, I know you, for Dr.",Dracula
345,"Seward has told me of you."" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all",Dracula
345,over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one,Dracula
345,"of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he",Dracula
345,said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,",Dracula
345,"you know, for she's dead."" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever",Dracula
345,"saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then what are you doing here?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then don't stay.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why not?"" I thought that this style of conversation might not be",Dracula
345,"pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""How did you know I wanted to marry any one?"" His reply was simply",Dracula
345,"contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.",Dracula
345,"Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What an asinine question!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"" said Mrs. Harker, at once",Dracula
345,championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as,Dracula
345,he had shown contempt to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so",Dracula
345,"loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of",Dracula
345,interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his,Dracula
345,"household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of",Dracula
345,"them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and",Dracula
345,"effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I",Dracula
345,cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates,Dracula
345,"lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_."" I",Dracula
345,positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet,Dracula
345,lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met,Dracula
345,"with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished",Dracula
345,gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched,Dracula
345,"some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any",Dracula
345,"way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or",Dracula
345,power.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly",Dracula
345,"quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she",Dracula
345,"began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for",Dracula
345,he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the,Dracula
345,completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned,Dracula
345,certain things.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,",Dracula
345,"it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being",Dracula
345,put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and,Dracula
345,"perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no",Dracula
345,"matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong",Dracula
345,life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to,Dracula
345,take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I,Dracula
345,tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by,Dracula
345,the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his,Dracula
345,"blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is",Dracula
345,"the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has",Dracula
345,"vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,",Dracula
345,"doctor?"" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to",Dracula
345,either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up,Dracula
345,"his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I",Dracula
345,"saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.",Dracula
345,"Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying",Dracula
345,"pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: ""Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,",Dracula
345,"under auspices pleasanter to yourself,"" to which, to my astonishment, he",Dracula
345,replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.",Dracula
345,"May He bless and keep you!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind,Dracula
345,me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took,Dracula
345,"ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for",Dracula
345,many a long day.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a,Dracula
345,"boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come",Dracula
345,"here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have",Dracula
345,much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And,Dracula
345,"Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own",Dracula
345,diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at,Dracula
345,which the Professor interrupted me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man",Dracula
345,should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God,Dracula
345,"fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good",Dracula
345,"combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help",Dracula
345,to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible,Dracula
345,affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are,Dracula
345,"determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is",Dracula
345,"no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her",Dracula
345,in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in,Dracula
345,"waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,",Dracula
345,she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to,Dracula
345,"think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she",Dracula
345,"must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and",Dracula
345,"we go alone."" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we",Dracula
345,had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was,Dracula
345,"the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed",Dracula
345,"to come on him. ""Oh that we had known it before!"" he said, ""for then we",Dracula
345,"might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk",Dracula
345,"that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think",Dracula
345,"of that, but go on our way to the end."" Then he fell into a silence that",Dracula
345,lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for,Dracula
345,dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have",Dracula
345,"put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not up to this moment, Professor,"" she said impulsively, ""but up to",Dracula
345,"this morning.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the",Dracula
345,"little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who",Dracula
345,"has told is the worse for it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she",Dracula
345,said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It",Dracula
345,is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at,Dracula
345,"present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except",Dracula
345,"what is personal. Must it go in?"" The Professor read it over gravely,",Dracula
345,"and handed it back, saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can",Dracula
345,"but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more",Dracula
345,"honour you--as well as more esteem and love."" She took it back with",Dracula
345,another blush and a bright smile.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete",Dracula
345,"and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,",Dracula
345,"and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us",Dracula
345,have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all,Dracula
345,"be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this",Dracula
345,terrible and mysterious enemy.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Mina Harker's Journal._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after,Dracula
345,"dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of",Dracula
345,"board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to",Dracula
345,which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit,Dracula
345,"next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat",Dracula
345,"next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.",Dracula
345,"Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the",Dracula
345,centre. The Professor said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts",Dracula
345,"that are in these papers."" We all expressed assent, and he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of",Dracula
345,enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you,Dracula
345,"something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.",Dracula
345,"So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure",Dracula
345,according.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they",Dracula
345,"exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the",Dracula
345,teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane,Dracula
345,peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that,Dracula
345,"through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not",Dracula
345,have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!,Dracula
345,"I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,",Dracula
345,had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of,Dracula
345,"us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other",Dracula
345,"poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die",Dracula
345,like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being,Dracula
345,"stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is",Dracula
345,amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of,Dracula
345,"cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have",Dracula
345,"still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the",Dracula
345,"divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are",Dracula
345,"for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in",Dracula
345,"callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear",Dracula
345,"at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he",Dracula
345,"can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the",Dracula
345,"thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and",Dracula
345,"the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become",Dracula
345,small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to,Dracula
345,begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having,Dracula
345,"found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible",Dracula
345,"task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave",Dracula
345,shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then,Dracula
345,"where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not",Dracula
345,mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward,Dracula
345,"become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,",Dracula
345,preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for,Dracula
345,ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?,Dracula
345,We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's,Dracula
345,sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face,Dracula
345,"to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;",Dracula
345,"but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his",Dracula
345,"song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are",Dracula
345,young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What,Dracula
345,"say you?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so",Dracula
345,"much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I",Dracula
345,saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so,Dracula
345,"strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for",Dracula
345,itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.,Dracula

345,"""Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not",Dracula
345,without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power,Dracula
345,denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to,Dracula
345,act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.,Dracula
345,"In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are",Dracula
345,"free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to",Dracula
345,achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are",Dracula
345,"restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the",Dracula
345,"limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not",Dracula
345,"at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay",Dracula
345,of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the,Dracula
345,first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and,Dracula
345,"secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and",Dracula
345,superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for,Dracula
345,"others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would",Dracula
345,"have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,",Dracula
345,"sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief",Dracula
345,"that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the",Dracula
345,"vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the",Dracula
345,"moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere",Dracula
345,"that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany",Dracula
345,"all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so",Dracula
345,"far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at",Dracula
345,"this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the",Dracula
345,"devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we",Dracula
345,have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the,Dracula
345,beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy,Dracula
345,"experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the",Dracula
345,time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the,Dracula
345,"living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow",Dracula
345,"younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though",Dracula
345,they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he,Dracula
345,cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend,Dracula
345,"Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!",Dracula
345,"He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again",Dracula
345,Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again,Dracula
345,"Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him",Dracula
345,"from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather",Dracula
345,"from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as",Dracula
345,"bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John",Dracula
345,"saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at",Dracula
345,the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble,Dracula
345,"ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance",Dracula
345,"he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He",Dracula
345,come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those,Dracula
345,sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw,Dracula
345,"Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the",Dracula
345,"tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or",Dracula
345,"into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with",Dracula
345,"fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,",Dracula
345,"in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me",Dracula
345,"through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even",Dracula
345,"more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.",Dracula
345,He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey,Dracula
345,some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the,Dracula
345,"first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;",Dracula
345,"though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does",Dracula
345,"that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times",Dracula
345,can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is,Dracula
345,"bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.",Dracula
345,"These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by",Dracula
345,"inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he",Dracula
345,"have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place",Dracula
345,"unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at",Dracula
345,Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is,Dracula
345,"said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood",Dracula
345,of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no,Dracula
345,"power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this",Dracula
345,"symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to",Dracula
345,"them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and",Dracula
345,"silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,",Dracula
345,lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his,Dracula
345,coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the,Dracula
345,coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through,Dracula
345,"him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.",Dracula
345,We have seen it with our eyes.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine",Dracula
345,"him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is",Dracula
345,"clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to",Dracula
345,"make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he",Dracula
345,"has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his",Dracula
345,"name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of",Dracula
345,"Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,",Dracula
345,"and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most",Dracula
345,"cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the",Dracula
345,forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his,Dracula
345,"grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says",Dracula
345,"Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who",Dracula
345,were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They,Dracula
345,"learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake",Dracula
345,"Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the",Dracula
345,"records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and",Dracula
345,'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is,Dracula
345,"spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been",Dracula
345,"from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their",Dracula
345,graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it,Dracula
345,is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in,Dracula
345,"all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,",Dracula
345,"and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little",Dracula
345,"pause, and then the Professor went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must",Dracula
345,proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan,Dracula
345,"that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which",Dracula
345,were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes,Dracula
345,"have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to",Dracula
345,ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall,Dracula
345,where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the,Dracula
345,"latter, we must trace----""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came,Dracula
345,the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a,Dracula
345,"bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the",Dracula
345,"far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked",Dracula
345,out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the,Dracula
345,window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice,Dracula
345,without:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about",Dracula
345,"it."" A minute later he came in and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.",Dracula
345,"Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But",Dracula
345,the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat,Dracula
345,and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned,Dracula
345,"brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to",Dracula
345,"have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have",Dracula
345,"seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Did you hit it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood."" Without",Dracula
345,"saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his",Dracula
345,statement:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must",Dracula
345,"either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to",Dracula
345,"speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.",Dracula
345,Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of,Dracula
345,"noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.",Dracula
345,"You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you",Dracula
345,no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men,Dracula
345,"and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we",Dracula
345,"shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we",Dracula
345,"are.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me",Dracula
345,"good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their",Dracula
345,safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their,Dracula
345,"minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,",Dracula
345,"I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--,Dracula

345,"""As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right",Dracula

345,"another victim.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so,Dracula
345,"close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I",Dracula
345,"appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave",Dracula
345,"me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,",Dracula
345,with means to get into the house.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can",Dracula

345,"_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an",Dracula
345,urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see,Dracula
345,"him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.",Dracula
345,I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the,Dracula
345,morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't",Dracula
345,"know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his",Dracula
345,"violent fits."" I knew the man would not have said this without some",Dracula
345,"cause, so I said: ""All right; I'll go now""; and I asked the others to",Dracula
345,"wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my ""patient.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Take me with you, friend John,"" said the Professor. ""His case in your",Dracula
345,"diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_",Dracula
345,"case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is",Dracula
345,"disturbed.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""May I come also?"" asked Lord Godalming.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Me too?"" said Quincey Morris. ""May I come?"" said Harker. I nodded, and",Dracula
345,we all went down the passage together.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more",Dracula
345,rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an,Dracula
345,"unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever",Dracula
345,met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would,Dracula
345,"prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but",Dracula
345,none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would,Dracula
345,at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up,Dracula
345,"with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own",Dracula
345,"existing sanity. ""I appeal to your friends,"" he said, ""they will,",Dracula
345,"perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have",Dracula
345,"not introduced me."" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of",Dracula
345,"introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,",Dracula
345,"besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of",Dracula
345,"the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: ""Lord",Dracula
345,"Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.",Dracula
345,"Renfield."" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the",Dracula
345,"Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no",Dracula
345,more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his,Dracula
345,"youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much",Dracula
345,"patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great",Dracula
345,state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have,Dracula
345,"far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold",Dracula
345,alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a,Dracula
345,"vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true",Dracula
345,place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at,Dracula
345,"meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of",Dracula
345,conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics,Dracula
345,"by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,",Dracula
345,"conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to",Dracula
345,"one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by",Dracula
345,"the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective",Dracula
345,"places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at",Dracula
345,least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.,Dracula
345,"And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as",Dracula
345,"well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to",Dracula
345,"be considered as under exceptional circumstances."" He made this last",Dracula
345,appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own,Dracula
345,charm.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the",Dracula
345,"conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,",Dracula
345,that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to,Dracula
345,"tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the",Dracula
345,necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it,Dracula
345,"better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old",Dracula
345,I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.,Dracula
345,So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared,Dracula
345,to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him,Dracula
345,"in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of",Dracula
345,"meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said",Dracula
345,quickly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to",Dracula
345,"go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time",Dracula
345,"presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of",Dracula
345,the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put,Dracula
345,"before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so",Dracula
345,"momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment."" He looked at me keenly, and",Dracula
345,"seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised",Dracula
345,"them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You have,"" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.",Dracula
345,"There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for",Dracula
345,"this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore",Dracula
345,"in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I",Dracula
345,"am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I",Dracula
345,"assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and",Dracula
345,"unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,",Dracula
345,"sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which",Dracula
345,"animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of",Dracula
345,"your friends."" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing",Dracula
345,conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was,Dracula
345,"but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let",Dracula
345,"him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like",Dracula
345,"all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at",Dracula
345,"him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting",Dracula
345,with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone,Dracula
345,"which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it",Dracula
345,afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free",Dracula
345,"to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,",Dracula
345,"without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.",Dracula
345,"Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the",Dracula
345,"privilege you seek."" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of",Dracula
345,poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the",Dracula
345,"highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete",Dracula
345,"reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since",Dracula
345,you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If,Dracula
345,"you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can",Dracula
345,"we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help",Dracula
345,"us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish."" He still shook",Dracula
345,his head as he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and",Dracula
345,if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my,Dracula
345,own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am,Dracula
345,"refused, the responsibility does not rest with me."" I thought it was now",Dracula
345,"time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went",Dracula
345,"towards the door, simply saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He",Dracula
345,moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was,Dracula
345,"about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were",Dracula
345,"groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his",Dracula
345,petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his,Dracula
345,"emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old",Dracula
345,"relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,",Dracula
345,and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more,Dracula
345,"fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his",Dracula
345,efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same,Dracula
345,constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of,Dracula
345,"which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he",Dracula
345,wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same,Dracula
345,"sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,",Dracula
345,"for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into",Dracula
345,"quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up",Dracula
345,"his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a",Dracula
345,"torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his",Dracula
345,whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out",Dracula
345,of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;,Dracula
345,send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a,Dracula
345,"strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go",Dracula
345,out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am,Dracula
345,speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know,Dracula
345,"whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.",Dracula
345,By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is,Dracula
345,"lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out",Dracula
345,"of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you",Dracula
345,understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and,Dracula
345,"earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting",Dracula
345,"for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so",Dracula
345,would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come,"" I said sternly, ""no more of this; we have had quite enough",Dracula
345,"already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,",Dracula
345,"without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the",Dracula
345,"bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had",Dracula
345,expected.,Dracula

345,"When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy",Dracula
345,"mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am",Dracula
345,so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.,Dracula
345,"Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at",Dracula
345,"all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and",Dracula
345,brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way,Dracula
345,"that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and",Dracula
345,"that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a",Dracula
345,little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his,Dracula
345,room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said,Dracula
345,to Dr. Seward:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the",Dracula
345,"sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some",Dracula
345,"serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a",Dracula
345,"chance."" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,",Dracula
345,for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last,Dracula
345,"hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in",Dracula
345,"our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.",Dracula
345,"All is best as they are."" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a",Dracula
345,dreamy kind of way:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an",Dracula
345,ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he,Dracula
345,seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am,Dracula
345,afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how,Dracula
345,"he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my",Dracula
345,"throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and",Dracula
345,"master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.",Dracula
345,That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help,Dracula
345,"him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He",Dracula
345,"certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is",Dracula
345,"best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,",Dracula
345,"help to unnerve a man."" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand",Dracula
345,"on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad",Dracula
345,and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to,Dracula
345,"hope for, except the pity of the good God?"" Lord Godalming had slipped",Dracula
345,"away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver",Dracula
345,"whistle, as he remarked:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on",Dracula
345,"call."" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care",Dracula
345,to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone,Dracula
345,out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out,Dracula
345,"a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four",Dracula
345,"little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of",Dracula
345,many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the,Dracula
345,"strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are",Dracula
345,of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not,Dracula
345,"amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong",Dracula
345,"in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him",Dracula
345,"as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his",Dracula
345,"touch. Keep this near your heart""--as he spoke he lifted a little silver",Dracula
345,"crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--""put these",Dracula
345,"flowers round your neck""--here he handed to me a wreath of withered",Dracula
345,"garlic blossoms--""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this",Dracula
345,"knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can",Dracula
345,"fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,",Dracula
345,"which we must not desecrate needless."" This was a portion of Sacred",Dracula
345,"Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others",Dracula
345,"was similarly equipped. ""Now,"" he said, ""friend John, where are the",Dracula
345,"skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house",Dracula
345,"by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a",Dracula
345,surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after,Dracula
345,"a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty",Dracula
345,"clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and",Dracula
345,it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in,Dracula
345,Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that,Dracula
345,"the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they",Dracula
345,"shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped",Dracula
345,into the open door.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""_In manus tuas, Domine!_"" he said, crossing himself as he passed over",Dracula
345,"the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have",Dracula
345,lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The,Dracula
345,"Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it",Dracula
345,from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our,Dracula
345,lamps and proceeded on our search.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the",Dracula
345,"rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great",Dracula
345,shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there,Dracula
345,"was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so",Dracula
345,"powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible",Dracula
345,"experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,",Dracula
345,for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every,Dracula
345,"sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches,Dracula
345,"deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down",Dracula
345,my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The,Dracula
345,"walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of",Dracula
345,"spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old",Dracula
345,tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the,Dracula
345,"hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They",Dracula
345,"had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents",Dracula
345,"in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor",Dracula
345,lifted them. He turned to me and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know",Dracula
345,"it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?"" I had an",Dracula
345,"idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to",Dracula
345,"get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings",Dracula
345,"found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.",Dracula
345,"""This is the spot,"" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small",Dracula
345,"map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence",Dracula
345,regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the,Dracula
345,"bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for",Dracula
345,"as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale",Dracula
345,"through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we",Dracula
345,encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close,Dracula
345,"quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of",Dracula
345,"his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in",Dracula
345,a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and,Dracula
345,"close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was",Dracula
345,"an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler",Dracula
345,"air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not",Dracula
345,alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the,Dracula
345,"pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had",Dracula
345,become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath,Dracula
345,exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and,Dracula
345,intensified its loathsomeness.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our,Dracula
345,"enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and",Dracula
345,terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose,Dracula
345,above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking,Dracula
345,"consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our",Dracula
345,work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we",Dracula
345,began:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then",Dracula
345,examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some,Dracula
345,"clue as to what has become of the rest."" A glance was sufficient to show",Dracula
345,"how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was",Dracula
345,no mistaking them.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,",Dracula
345,"for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted",Dracula
345,"door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my",Dracula
345,"heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to",Dracula
345,"see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the",Dracula
345,"red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,",Dracula
345,"as Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw a face, but it was only the",Dracula
345,"shadows,"" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,",Dracula
345,and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there,Dracula
345,"were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid",Dracula
345,"walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I",Dracula
345,"took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which",Dracula
345,"he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for",Dracula
345,"undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass",Dracula
345,"of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew",Dracula
345,back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was",Dracula
345,seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great,Dracula
345,"iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,",Dracula
345,"and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the",Dracula
345,"huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver",Dracula
345,"whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered",Dracula
345,"from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a",Dracula
345,minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.,Dracula
345,"Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I",Dracula
345,noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been,Dracula
345,taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had,Dracula
345,elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to,Dracula
345,"swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their",Dracula
345,"moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look",Dracula
345,"like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the",Dracula
345,"threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting",Dracula
345,"their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were",Dracula
345,"multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him",Dracula
345,on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to,Dracula
345,"recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before",Dracula
345,"him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other",Dracula
345,"dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey",Dracula
345,ere the whole mass had vanished.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for",Dracula
345,the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at,Dracula
345,"their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in",Dracula
345,the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.,Dracula
345,Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of,Dracula
345,"the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves",Dracula
345,in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to,Dracula
345,"slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something",Dracula
345,"of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our",Dracula
345,"resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and",Dracula
345,"bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found",Dracula
345,"nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all",Dracula
345,untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.,Dracula
345,"Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when",Dracula
345,we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been,Dracula
345,rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.,Dracula
345,"Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and",Dracula
345,"locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket",Dracula
345,when he had done.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""So far,"" he said, ""our night has been eminently successful. No harm has",Dracula
345,come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how,Dracula
345,"many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our",Dracula
345,first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been,Dracula
345,accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or,Dracula
345,troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and,Dracula
345,"smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have",Dracula
345,"learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute",Dracula
345,beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable,Dracula
345,"to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his",Dracula
345,"call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and",Dracula
345,"to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell",Dracula
345,from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters,Dracula
345,"before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used",Dracula
345,his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.,Dracula
345,So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity,Dracula
345,"to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the",Dracula
345,"stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,",Dracula
345,and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be,Dracula
345,"ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;",Dracula
345,"but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who",Dracula
345,"was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound",Dracula
345,"from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,",Dracula
345,"after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so",Dracula
345,softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than,Dracula
345,usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly,Dracula
345,"thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our",Dracula
345,deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not,Dracula
345,"think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is",Dracula
345,settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet,Dracula
345,to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she,Dracula
345,suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a,Dracula
345,"sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all",Dracula
345,"is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I",Dracula
345,daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such,Dracula
345,"confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep",Dracula
345,"dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that",Dracula
345,"has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.",Dracula

345,"_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all",Dracula
345,"overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no",Dracula
345,"rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept",Dracula
345,"till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or",Dracula
345,"three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a",Dracula
345,"few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of",Dracula
345,"blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She",Dracula
345,"complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the",Dracula
345,"day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be",Dracula
345,that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace,Dracula
345,"them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the",Dracula
345,sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas,Dracula

345,_Dr. Seward's Diary._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor,Dracula
345,"walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it",Dracula
345,is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the,Dracula
345,brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the,Dracula
345,night he suddenly said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him",Dracula
345,"this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may",Dracula
345,"be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,",Dracula
345,"and reason so sound."" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him",Dracula
345,"that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to",Dracula
345,keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary,Dracula
345,instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against,Dracula
345,"getting any false impression from my patient. ""But,"" he answered, ""I",Dracula
345,want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live,Dracula
345,"things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that",Dracula
345,"he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here."" I laid my hand on the",Dracula
345,"type-written matter. ""When our sane and learned lunatic made that very",Dracula
345,"statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually",Dracula
345,nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.,Dracula
345,"Harker entered the room."" Van Helsing smiled in turn. ""Good!"" he said.",Dracula
345,"""Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it",Dracula
345,is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease,Dracula
345,such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the,Dracula
345,folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.,Dracula
345,"Who knows?"" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in",Dracula
345,"hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing back in the study. ""Do I interrupt?"" he asked politely as he",Dracula
345,stood at the door.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not at all,"" I answered. ""Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.",Dracula
345,"I can go with you now, if you like.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is needless; I have seen him!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.",Dracula
345,"When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with",Dracula
345,"his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen",Dracula
345,"discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a",Dracula
345,"measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. ""Don't",Dracula
345,"you know me?"" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: ""I know you well",Dracula
345,enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself,Dracula
345,and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed,Dracula
345,"Dutchmen!"" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable",Dracula
345,sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at,Dracula
345,all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so,Dracula
345,"clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few",Dracula
345,"happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does",Dracula
345,"rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be",Dracula
345,"worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it",Dracula
345,"is better so.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I agree with you with all my heart,"" I answered earnestly, for I did",Dracula
345,"not want him to weaken in this matter. ""Mrs. Harker is better out of it.",Dracula
345,"Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have",Dracula
345,"been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,",Dracula
345,"and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time",Dracula
345,"infallibly have wrecked her.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey,Dracula

345,_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;,Dracula
345,"after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him",Dracula
345,"manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This",Dracula
345,"morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though",Dracula
345,"Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went",Dracula
345,"out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of",Dracula
345,what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must,Dracula
345,have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it,Dracula
345,must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that,Dracula
345,"it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and",Dracula
345,I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am,Dracula
345,"crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great",Dracula
345,"love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and",Dracula
345,lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept,Dracula
345,"anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has",Dracula
345,"feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my",Dracula
345,heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and,Dracula
345,low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible,Dracula
345,excitement.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told",Dracula
345,"me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I",Dracula
345,kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to,Dracula
345,"see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate",Dracula
345,pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does,Dracula
345,"seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which",Dracula
345,"is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear",Dracula
345,Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard,Dracula
345,"till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she",Dracula
345,wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at,Dracula
345,"night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.",Dracula
345,"Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what",Dracula
345,"has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew",Dracula
345,"that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my",Dracula
345,"own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear",Dracula
345,"fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do",Dracula
345,"feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons",Dracula
345,that we poor women have to learn....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing,Dracula
345,"the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying",Dracula
345,"on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere",Dracula
345,"under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so",Dracula
345,"profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.",Dracula
345,"All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight",Dracula
345,seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be,Dracula
345,"stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin",Dracula
345,"streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness",Dracula
345,"across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a",Dracula
345,vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must,Dracula
345,"have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy",Dracula
345,"creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out",Dracula
345,"and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now",Dracula
345,"close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the",Dracula
345,"wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was",Dracula
345,"more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,",Dracula
345,I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on,Dracula
345,"his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the",Dracula
345,attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into,Dracula
345,"bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.",Dracula
345,"I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have",Dracula
345,"fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the",Dracula
345,"morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a",Dracula
345,"little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was",Dracula
345,"bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of",Dracula
345,"the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I",Dracula
345,"was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my",Dracula
345,"hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the",Dracula
345,usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn,Dracula
345,"upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the",Dracula
345,"clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim",Dracula
345,"around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,",Dracula
345,"came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently",Dracula
345,grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I,Dracula
345,had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to,Dracula
345,"make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my",Dracula
345,limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed,Dracula
345,"my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what",Dracula
345,"tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The",Dracula
345,"mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I",Dracula
345,could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling,Dracula
345,"water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of",Dracula
345,"the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became",Dracula
345,"concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top",Dracula
345,of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things,Dracula
345,began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now,Dracula
345,"whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words ""a",Dracula
345,"pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night."" Was it indeed some such",Dracula
345,spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was,Dracula
345,"composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the",Dracula
345,"red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I",Dracula
345,"looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like",Dracula
345,"two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering",Dracula
345,"when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's",Dracula
345,Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan,Dracula
345,had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist,Dracula
345,"in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became",Dracula
345,black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to,Dracula
345,show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be,Dracula
345,"careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were",Dracula
345,too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe,Dracula
345,"something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm",Dracula
345,them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their,Dracula
345,fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do,Dracula
345,"not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that",Dracula
345,"cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last",Dracula
345,night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.,Dracula

345,"_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have",Dracula
345,"slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the",Dracula
345,"sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and",Dracula
345,"spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.",Dracula
345,"In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was",Dracula
345,"very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless",Dracula
345,me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This,Dracula
345,"is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be",Dracula
345,miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till,Dracula
345,"dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten",Dracula
345,"them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how",Dracula
345,"tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke",Dracula
345,"together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other",Dracula
345,of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's,Dracula
345,manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so,Dracula
345,sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to,Dracula
345,"give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night",Dracula
345,"before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to",Dracula
345,"me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I",Dracula
345,"have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope",Dracula
345,"I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear",Dracula
345,comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the,Dracula
345,power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal",Dracula
345,"Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The",Dracula
345,very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had,Dracula
345,"proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I",Dracula
345,"learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he",Dracula
345,"was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the",Dracula
345,"responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph",Dracula
345,"Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a",Dracula
345,"saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable",Dracula
345,"type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all",Dracula
345,"about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared",Dracula
345,"notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the",Dracula
345,"seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,",Dracula
345,"half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There",Dracula
345,"were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at",Dracula
345,"197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he",Dracula
345,"deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to",Dracula
345,"scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were",Dracula
345,"chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more",Dracula
345,fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that,Dracula
345,he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now,Dracula
345,"fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern",Dracula
345,"shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to",Dracula
345,be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the,Dracula
345,very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back,Dracula
345,"to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had",Dracula
345,been taken from Carfax.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some""--I had given him half a",Dracula
345,"sovereign--""an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of",Dracula
345,"Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,",Dracula
345,as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at,Dracula
345,"Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'",Dracula
345,"that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."" I asked if he could tell me",Dracula
345,where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it,Dracula
345,would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest,Dracula
345,"of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search",Dracula
345,"then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I",Dracula
345,"may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way",Dracula
345,to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.,Dracula
345,"If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on",Dracula
345,"it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But",Dracula
345,"ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch",Dracula
345,"'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to",Dracula
345,"buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she",Dracula
345,"came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had",Dracula
345,"again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way",Dracula
345,"to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.",Dracula
345,"Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as",Dracula
345,"though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be",Dracula
345,"kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the",Dracula
345,others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and,Dracula
345,worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors,Dracula
345,were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful,Dracula
345,"business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence",Dracula
345,must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any,Dracula
345,"circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she",Dracula
345,"herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the",Dracula
345,Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.,Dracula

345,"_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first",Dracula
345,"post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on",Dracula
345,which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for",Dracula
345,"the depite.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy",Dracula
345,"and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,",Dracula
345,"but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for",Dracula
345,"her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,",Dracula
345,"with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and",Dracula
345,"in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I",Dracula
345,"was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should",Dracula
345,"have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some",Dracula
345,"difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked",Dracula
345,"for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found",Dracula
345,"the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.",Dracula
345,"When I asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" he shook his",Dracula
345,"head, and said: ""I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never",Dracula
345,'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody,Dracula
345,"of that kind livin' ere or anywheres."" I took out Smollet's letter, and",Dracula
345,as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name,Dracula
345,"of the court might guide me. ""What are you?"" I asked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I'm the depity,"" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right",Dracula
345,track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the,Dracula
345,"deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who",Dracula
345,had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at,Dracula
345,"Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that",Dracula
345,"morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but",Dracula
345,"he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a ""new-fangled ware'us"";",Dracula
345,and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve,Dracula
345,"o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this",Dracula
345,"I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One",Dracula
345,of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a,Dracula
345,"new ""cold storage"" building; and as this suited the condition of a",Dracula
345,"""new-fangled ware'us,"" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly",Dracula
345,"gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the",Dracula
345,"coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my",Dracula
345,suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for,Dracula
345,the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was,Dracula
345,"a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had",Dracula
345,"promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me",Dracula
345,"that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,",Dracula
345,"and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--""main",Dracula
345,"heavy ones""--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I",Dracula
345,"asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to",Dracula
345,which he replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a",Dracula
345,"big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a",Dracula
345,"dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we",Dracula

345,"""Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was",Dracula
345,"main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome."" I",Dracula
345,interrupted him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Were the boxes left in the hall?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it."" I made one",Dracula
345,more attempt to further matters:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You didn't have any key?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself",Dracula
345,an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but,Dracula
345,"that was the beer.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And you can't remember the number of the house?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un",Dracula
345,"with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I",Dracula
345,"know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers",Dracula
345,"what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'",Dracula
345,"they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them",Dracula
345,"by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot",Dracula
345,"of them went away cussin'."" I thought that with this description I could",Dracula
345,"find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started",Dracula
345,off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count,Dracula
345,"could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was",Dracula
345,"precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of",Dracula
345,"distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task",Dracula
345,"unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked",Dracula
345,westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house,Dracula
345,"described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs",Dracula
345,arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long,Dracula
345,"untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were",Dracula
345,"up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint",Dracula
345,had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been,Dracula
345,"a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been",Dracula
345,"roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.",Dracula
345,"Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,",Dracula
345,whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have,Dracula
345,"been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have",Dracula
345,given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my,Dracula
345,"experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not",Dracula
345,but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means,Dracula
345,discovered of gaining access to the house.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and",Dracula
345,nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything,Dracula
345,"could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the",Dracula
345,Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the,Dracula
345,grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything,Dracula
345,about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been,Dracula
345,"taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to",Dracula
345,"very lately there had been a notice-board of ""For Sale"" up, and that",Dracula
345,"perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me",Dracula
345,"something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on",Dracula
345,"the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know",Dracula
345,"or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled",Dracula
345,"away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I",Dracula
345,"did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &",Dracula
345,"Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in",Dracula
345,Sackville Street.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but",Dracula
345,uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the,Dracula
345,Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a,Dracula
345,"""mansion""--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I",Dracula
345,"asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and",Dracula
345,paused a few seconds before replying:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""Surely,"" I said, ""you do not mind letting me know so much.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But I do mind,"" he answered. ""The affairs of their clients are",Dracula
345,"absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy."" This was",Dracula
345,"manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with",Dracula
345,"him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--",Dracula

345,"Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,",Dracula
345,"he understood, lately for sale."" These words put a different complexion",Dracula
345,on affairs. He said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of,Dracula
345,renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur,Dracula
345,Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult,Dracula
345,"the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his",Dracula
345,lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far,Dracula
345,deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his,Dracula
345,"lordship.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,",Dracula
345,"gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I",Dracula
345,was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company,Dracula
345,and came down to Purfleet by the next train.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she",Dracula
345,"made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to",Dracula
345,think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her,Dracula
345,"inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at",Dracula
345,"our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our",Dracula
345,confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of,Dracula
345,keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or,Dracula
345,"else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when",Dracula
345,any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we,Dracula
345,"made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing",Dracula
345,knowledge would be torture to her.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;,Dracula
345,so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even,Dracula
345,amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.,Dracula
345,"The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me",Dracula
345,as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I,Dracula
345,"came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no",Dracula
345,difference between us.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in,Dracula
345,"the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read",Dracula
345,it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own,Dracula
345,information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on",Dracula
345,"the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then",Dracula
345,"our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search",Dracula
345,"until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the",Dracula
345,"wretch to his real death."" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.",Dracula
345,Morris spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Say! how are we going to get into that house?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We got into the other,"" answered Lord Godalming quickly.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night",Dracula
345,and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to,Dracula
345,"commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't",Dracula
345,see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key,Dracula
345,of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the,Dracula
345,"morning."" Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked",Dracula
345,"about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to",Dracula
345,another of us:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we",Dracula
345,got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we,Dracula
345,"can find the Count's key basket.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at",Dracula
345,"least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,",Dracula
345,we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good,Dracula
345,"while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and",Dracula
345,bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the,Dracula
345,moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her,Dracula
345,"forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even",Dracula
345,"in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she",Dracula
345,"did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be",Dracula
345,"herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so,Dracula
345,"rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they",Dracula
345,"always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more",Dracula
345,"than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his",Dracula
345,"repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.",Dracula
345,"He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really",Dracula
345,care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and,Dracula
345,looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I,Dracula
345,"thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked",Dracula
345,him:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What about the flies these times?"" He smiled on me in quite a superior",Dracula
345,sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as,Dracula
345,he answered me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical",Dracula
345,of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well,Dracula
345,"when they typified the soul as a butterfly!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said",Dracula
345,quickly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?"" His madness foiled his",Dracula
345,"reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head",Dracula
345,"with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want."" Here he brightened",Dracula
345,"up; ""I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I",Dracula
345,"have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to",Dracula
345,"study zoöphagy!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?"" He smiled with an",Dracula
345,ineffably benign superiority.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the",Dracula
345,Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I,Dracula
345,"may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things",Dracula
345,"purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied",Dracula
345,"spiritually!"" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall",Dracula
345,"Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt",Dracula
345,that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And why with Enoch?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Because he walked with God."" I could not see the analogy, but did not",Dracula
345,like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?"" I put",Dracula
345,"my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.",Dracula
345,The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his,Dracula
345,"old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as",Dracula
345,he replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if",Dracula
345,I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them,Dracula
345,"or----"" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his",Dracula
345,"face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. ""And doctor, as to",Dracula
345,"life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you",Dracula
345,"know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good",Dracula
345,"friends--like you, Dr. Seward""; this was said with a leer of",Dracula
345,"inexpressible cunning. ""I know that I shall never lack the means of",Dracula
345,"life!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some,Dracula
345,"antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as",Dracula
345,he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it,Dracula
345,"was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come,Dracula
345,"without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him",Dracula
345,"that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything",Dracula
345,"to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are",Dracula
345,Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the,Dracula
345,record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate,Dracula
345,knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish,Dracula
345,"to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with",Dracula
345,"me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he",Dracula
345,might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield,Dracula
345,might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were,Dracula
345,alone.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose",Dracula
345,which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I,Dracula
345,"came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his",Dracula
345,lips:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What about souls?"" It was evident then that my surmise had been",Dracula
345,"correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the",Dracula
345,"lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. ""What about them",Dracula
345,"yourself?"" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round",Dracula
345,"him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for",Dracula
345,an answer.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't want any souls!"" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The",Dracula
345,"matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to ""be",Dracula
345,"cruel only to be kind."" So I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You like life, and you want life?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But,"" I asked, ""how are we to get the life without getting the soul",Dracula
345,"also?"" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with",Dracula
345,the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing,Dracula
345,"and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you",Dracula
345,"know, and you must put up with their souls!"" Something seemed to affect",Dracula
345,"his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,",Dracula
345,screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being,Dracula
345,soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave,Dracula
345,"me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,",Dracula
345,"though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It",Dracula
345,"was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,",Dracula
345,"and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign",Dracula
345,"to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and",Dracula
345,"go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,",Dracula
345,speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?"" He seemed to",Dracula
345,"wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not much! flies are poor things, after all!"" After a pause he added,",Dracula
345,"""But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Or spiders?"" I went on.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them",Dracula
345,"to eat or""--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden",Dracula
345,topic.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""So, so!"" I thought to myself, ""this is the second time he has suddenly",Dracula
345,"stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?"" Renfield seemed himself",Dracula
345,"aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract",Dracula
345,my attention from it:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such",Dracula
345,"small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they",Dracula
345,might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well,Dracula
345,"ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to",Dracula
345,"interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before",Dracula
345,"me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I see,"" I said. ""You want big things that you can make your teeth meet",Dracula
345,"in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!"" He was getting too wide",Dracula
345,"awake, so I thought I would press him hard. ""I wonder,"" I said",Dracula
345,"reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his",Dracula
345,high-horse and became a child again.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"" he said. For a",Dracula
345,"few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with",Dracula
345,"his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. ""To",Dracula
345,"hell with you and your souls!"" he shouted. ""Why do you plague me about",Dracula
345,"souls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,",Dracula
345,"without thinking of souls!"" He looked so hostile that I thought he was",Dracula
345,"in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,",Dracula
345,"however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so",Dracula
345,worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the,Dracula
345,"problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and",Dracula
345,"tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I",Dracula
345,want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am,Dracula
345,"sure you will understand!"" He had evidently self-control; so when the",Dracula
345,"attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield",Dracula
345,"watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable",Dracula
345,dignity and sweetness:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that",Dracula
345,"I am very, very grateful to you!"" I thought it well to leave him in this",Dracula
345,"mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in",Dracula
345,this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American,Dracula
345,"interviewer calls ""a story,"" if one could only get them in proper order.",Dracula
345,Here they are:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Will not mention ""drinking.""",Dracula

345,haunted by their souls.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind,Dracula

345,"we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time",Dracula
345,which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that,Dracula
345,"he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the",Dracula

345,something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if,Dracula

345,"left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it",Dracula
345,became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;,Dracula
345,there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body,Dracula
345,which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see,Dracula
345,"that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the",Dracula
345,floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood,Dracula
345,originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as,Dracula
345,we turned him over:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and",Dracula
345,"the whole side of his face are paralysed."" How such a thing could have",Dracula
345,happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite,Dracula
345,"bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by",Dracula
345,beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the,Dracula
345,Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he,Dracula
345,"might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward",Dracula
345,kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things,Dracula
345,"occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his",Dracula
345,"face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of",Dracula
345,"it."" I said to him:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want",Dracula
345,"him without an instant's delay."" The man ran off, and within a few",Dracula
345,"minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When",Dracula
345,"he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and",Dracula
345,"then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he",Dracula
345,"said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much",Dracula
345,attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.,Dracula
345,"If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that,Dracula
345,he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with,Dracula
345,"extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had",Dracula
345,"evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he",Dracula
345,"looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes",Dracula
345,"conscious, after the operation."" So I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at",Dracula
345,"present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.",Dracula
345,"Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.",Dracula
345,The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed,Dracula
345,"fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The",Dracula
345,Professor thought a moment and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far",Dracula
345,as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of,Dracula
345,his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the,Dracula
345,"brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be",Dracula
345,"too late."" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I",Dracula
345,"went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and",Dracula
345,Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.",Dracula
345,So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things,Dracula
345,are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us,Dracula
345,these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things,Dracula
345,as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more,Dracula
345,"than we have done. May we come in?"" I nodded, and held the door open",Dracula
345,till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the,Dracula
345,"attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the",Dracula
345,"floor, he said softly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!"" I told him",Dracula
345,"briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after",Dracula
345,"the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat",Dracula
345,"down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched",Dracula
345,in patience.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We shall wait,"" said Van Helsing, ""just long enough to fix the best",Dracula
345,"spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove",Dracula
345,"the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a,Dracula
345,"horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered",Dracula
345,that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded,Dracula
345,the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;,Dracula
345,"but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men",Dracula
345,who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in,Dracula
345,uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes,Dracula
345,"and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he",Dracula
345,would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick,Dracula
345,"beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost",Dracula
345,hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my,Dracula
345,temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became,Dracula
345,"agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from",Dracula
345,their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal,Dracula
345,"torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead",Dracula
345,some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect,Dracula
345,it.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was,Dracula
345,sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor,Dracula
345,and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he,Dracula
345,spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have",Dracula
345,"been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!",Dracula
345,"We shall operate just above the ear.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the,Dracula
345,breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so,Dracula
345,prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.,Dracula
345,"Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.",Dracula
345,This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad,Dracula
345,"surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved",Dracula
345,"convulsively, and as he did so, said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I",Dracula
345,"have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot",Dracula
345,"move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts",Dracula
345,"dreadfully."" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his",Dracula
345,eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van,Dracula
345,Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield."" As he heard the voice his face",Dracula
345,"brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some",Dracula
345,"water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed""--he",Dracula
345,"stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--""The",Dracula
345,"brandy--it is in my study--quick!"" He flew and returned with a glass,",Dracula
345,the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched,Dracula
345,"lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor",Dracula
345,"injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite",Dracula
345,"conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I",Dracula
345,"shall never forget, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.""",Dracula
345,Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two,Dracula
345,figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""If I were not sure already, I would know from them."" For an instant his",Dracula
345,"eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were",Dracula
345,"bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,",Dracula
345,"hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;",Dracula
345,and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy,Dracula
345,again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor,Dracula
345,crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left,Dracula
345,"me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I",Dracula
345,"felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as",Dracula
345,I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left,Dracula
345,me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain,Dracula
345,"seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the",Dracula
345,"dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!"" As he spoke, Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and",Dracula
345,"gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly",Dracula
345,"and said: ""Go on,"" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;",Dracula
345,"but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a",Dracula
345,man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white,Dracula
345,teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt,Dracula
345,"of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in",Dracula
345,"at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.",Dracula
345,"Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them."" He",Dracula
345,was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""How?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the",Dracula
345,sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their,Dracula
345,"wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their",Dracula
345,"backs."" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the",Dracula
345,"'Death's-head Moth'?"" The patient went on without stopping.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,",Dracula
345,"millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats",Dracula
345,"too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely",Dracula
345,"buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.",Dracula
345,"Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He",Dracula
345,"beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his",Dracula
345,"hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass",Dracula
345,"spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and",Dracula
345,"then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there",Dracula
345,"were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only",Dracula
345,"smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he",Dracula
345,"seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more",Dracula
345,"and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship",Dracula
345,"me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close",Dracula
345,"over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening",Dracula
345,"the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were",Dracula
345,"all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only",Dracula
345,open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through,Dracula
345,the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and,Dracula
345,"splendour.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and",Dracula
345,he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in,Dracula
345,the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him,Dracula
345,"back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: ""Let him go on. Do",Dracula
345,"not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all",Dracula
345,"if once he lost the thread of his thought."" He proceeded:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not",Dracula
345,"even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.",Dracula
345,"When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even",Dracula
345,"knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked",Dracula
345,"out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he",Dracula
345,"owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same",Dracula
345,"as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.",Dracula
345,"Harker had come into the room.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind",Dracula
345,"him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.",Dracula
345,"They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,",Dracula
345,"however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without",Dracula
345,noticing:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;",Dracula
345,"it was like tea after the teapot had been watered."" Here we all moved,",Dracula
345,but no one said a word; he went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the",Dracula
345,same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood,Dracula
345,"in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it",Dracula
345,"at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad",Dracula
345,"to know that He had been taking the life out of her."" I could feel that",Dracula
345,"the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. ""So when",Dracula
345,"He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I",Dracula
345,grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and,Dracula
345,as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.,Dracula
345,"Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle",Dracula
345,"with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't",Dracula
345,"mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned",Dracula
345,"into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and",Dracula
345,"when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There",Dracula
345,"was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed",Dracula
345,"to steal away under the door."" His voice was becoming fainter and his",Dracula
345,breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We know the worst now,"" he said. ""He is here, and we know his purpose.",Dracula
345,It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other,Dracula
345,"night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare."" There was no",Dracula
345,"need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in",Dracula
345,common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we,Dracula
345,"had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and",Dracula
345,as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is",Dracula
345,"over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.",Dracula
345,"Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!"" He stopped; his",Dracula
345,"voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in",Dracula
345,my own heart.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the",Dracula
345,latter said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Should we disturb her?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We must,"" said Van Helsing grimly. ""If the door be locked, I shall",Dracula
345,"break it in.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's",Dracula
345,"room!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing said solemnly, ""You are always right; but this is life and",Dracula
345,death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they,Dracula
345,"are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if",Dracula
345,"the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you",Dracula
345,"too, my friends. Now!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw",Dracula
345,"ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell",Dracula
345,"headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw",Dracula
345,across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw,Dracula
345,"appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,",Dracula
345,and my heart seemed to stand still.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room,Dracula
345,was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan,Dracula
345,"Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.",Dracula
345,Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad,Dracula
345,"figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.",Dracula
345,"His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised",Dracula
345,"the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left",Dracula
345,"hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms",Dracula
345,"at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,",Dracula
345,forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared,Dracula
345,"with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which",Dracula
345,was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible,Dracula
345,resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to,Dracula
345,"compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his",Dracula
345,"face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap",Dracula
345,into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils,Dracula
345,of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the,Dracula
345,"white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,",Dracula
345,"champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw",Dracula
345,"his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned",Dracula
345,"and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,",Dracula
345,and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred,Dracula
345,"Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside",Dracula
345,"the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,",Dracula
345,"lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a",Dracula
345,great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up,Dracula
345,"under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we",Dracula
345,"looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting",Dracula
345,"open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved",Dracula
345,"forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with",Dracula
345,"it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it",Dracula
345,seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a,Dracula
345,few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was,Dracula
345,"ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared",Dracula
345,her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of,Dracula
345,blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her,Dracula
345,"poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the",Dracula
345,"Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail",Dracula
345,which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an,Dracula
345,endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently,Dracula
345,"over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant",Dracula
345,"despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can",Dracula
345,do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers,Dracula
345,"herself; I must wake him!"" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water",Dracula
345,"and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while",Dracula
345,holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was,Dracula
345,"heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the",Dracula
345,window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey,Dracula
345,Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great,Dracula
345,yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the,Dracula
345,instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial,Dracula
345,"consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well",Dracula
345,"be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and",Dracula
345,"then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he",Dracula
345,"started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to",Dracula
345,"him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,",Dracula
345,"however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held",Dracula
345,"her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""In God's name what does this mean?"" Harker cried out. ""Dr. Seward, Dr.",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,",Dracula
345,"what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to",Dracula
345,"this!"" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly",Dracula
345,"together. ""Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!"" With a quick",Dracula
345,"movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the",Dracula
345,"man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. ""What has happened?",Dracula
345,"Tell me all about it!"" he cried without pausing. ""Dr. Van Helsing, you",Dracula
345,"love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too",Dracula
345,"far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!"" His wife, through her terror",Dracula
345,"and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly",Dracula
345,"forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough",Dracula
345,"to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay",Dracula
345,"with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"" Her",Dracula
345,"expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she",Dracula
345,"pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his,Dracula
345,"little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no",Dracula
345,foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm,Dracula
345,"and take counsel together."" She shuddered and was silent, holding down",Dracula
345,"her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white",Dracula
345,"night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where",Dracula
345,the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she,Dracula
345,"saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking",Dracula
345,sobs:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it",Dracula
345,"should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have",Dracula
345,"most cause to fear."" To this he spoke out resolutely:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not",Dracula
345,hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my,Dracula
345,"deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,",Dracula
345,"if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!"" He put out",Dracula
345,his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there,Dracula
345,"sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked",Dracula
345,damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a,Dracula
345,"while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to",Dracula
345,"me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous",Dracula
345,power to the utmost:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad",Dracula
345,"fact; tell me all that has been."" I told him exactly what had happened,",Dracula
345,and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched,Dracula
345,and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had,Dracula
345,"held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to",Dracula
345,"the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to",Dracula
345,"see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over",Dracula
345,"the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled",Dracula
345,"hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.",Dracula
345,They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me,Dracula
345,questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of,Dracula
345,their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband,Dracula
345,and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence,Dracula
345,to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming,Dracula
345,answered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I",Dracula
345,"looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,",Dracula
345,"however----"" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on",Dracula
345,the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now",Dracula
345,"is in knowing all. Tell freely!"" So Art went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few",Dracula
345,"seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been",Dracula
345,"burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the",Dracula
345,"cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax",Dracula
345,"had helped the flames."" Here I interrupted. ""Thank God there is the",Dracula
345,"other copy in the safe!"" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he",Dracula
345,"went on: ""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked",Dracula
345,"into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!"" Again he",Dracula
345,"paused. ""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and",Dracula
345,"moistening his lips with his tongue, added: ""except that the poor fellow",Dracula
345,"is dead."" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of",Dracula
345,us she said solemnly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""God's will be done!"" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back",Dracula
345,"something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.",Dracula
345,Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""A little,"" he answered. ""It may be much eventually, but at present I",Dracula
345,can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would,Dracula
345,go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from,Dracula
345,"Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some",Dracula
345,shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He,Dracula
345,"will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the",Dracula
345,"dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps,Dracula
345,"a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could",Dracula
345,"hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his",Dracula
345,hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what",Dracula
345,happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is,Dracula
345,need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done,Dracula
345,"quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must",Dracula
345,"end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and",Dracula
345,"learn.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves",Dracula
345,as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and,Dracula
345,"lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held",Dracula
345,"out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and",Dracula
345,"kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that",Dracula
345,"of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.",Dracula
345,"After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she",Dracula
345,began:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a",Dracula
345,"long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads",Dracula
345,of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them,Dracula
345,"connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.""",Dracula
345,Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said,Dracula
345,"lovingly: ""Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me",Dracula
345,through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me,Dracula
345,"to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I",Dracula
345,"need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work",Dracula
345,"with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to",Dracula
345,"sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no",Dracula
345,"more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when",Dracula
345,next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I,Dracula
345,had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find,Dracula
345,it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague,Dracula
345,terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.,Dracula
345,"I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it",Dracula
345,"seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I",Dracula
345,"tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I",Dracula
345,"looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside",Dracula
345,"the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist",Dracula
345,"had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a",Dracula
345,"tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of",Dracula
345,"the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light",Dracula
345,"fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white",Dracula
345,teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the,Dracula
345,"sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the",Dracula
345,red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant,Dracula
345,"my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was",Dracula
345,"paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,",Dracula
345,pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out",Dracula
345,before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or,Dracula
345,"say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder",Dracula
345,"and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did",Dracula
345,"so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well",Dracula
345,"be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have",Dracula
345,"appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not",Dracula
345,want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that,Dracula
345,"such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity",Dracula
345,"me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!"" Her husband groaned",Dracula
345,"again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if",Dracula
345,"he were the injured one, and went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long",Dracula
345,this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time,Dracula
345,"must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I",Dracula
345,"saw it drip with the fresh blood!"" The remembrance seemed for a while to",Dracula
345,"overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her",Dracula
345,husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and,Dracula
345,went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play",Dracula
345,your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and,Dracula
345,"frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,",Dracula
345,"and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They",Dracula
345,should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they,Dracula
345,"played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued",Dracula
345,"for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were",Dracula
345,"born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now",Dracula
345,"to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful",Dracula
345,wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my,Dracula
345,helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall,Dracula
345,minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you,Dracula
345,have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my,Dracula
345,"call. When my brain says ""Come!"" to you, you shall cross land or sea to",Dracula
345,do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his,Dracula
345,"shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When",Dracula
345,"the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding",Dracula
345,"them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to",Dracula
345,"the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh",Dracula
345,my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a,Dracula
345,"fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my",Dracula
345,days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;,Dracula
345,"and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!"" Then she began to rub her",Dracula
345,lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,",Dracula
345,and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;,Dracula
345,"but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look",Dracula
345,"which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first",Dracula
345,"red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out",Dracula
345,against the whitening hair.,Dracula

345,We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It",Dracula
345,"is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and",Dracula
345,take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed,Dracula
345,"that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God",Dracula
345,"knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare",Dracula
345,"not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end",Dracula
345,"the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could",Dracula
345,"not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,",Dracula
345,"we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears",Dracula
345,"running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our",Dracula
345,faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us,Dracula
345,up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor,Dracula
345,"Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward",Dracula
345,told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below,Dracula
345,"they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was",Dracula
345,"all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had,Dracula
345,heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to,Dracula
345,"half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield",Dracula
345,"had called out loudly several times, ""God! God! God!"" after that there",Dracula
345,"was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying",Dracula
345,"on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing",Dracula
345,"asked if he had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and he said he could not",Dracula
345,"say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as",Dracula
345,there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear,Dracula
345,"to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken by the patient. Dr.",Dracula
345,"Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into",Dracula
345,"the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it",Dracula
345,"would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As",Dracula
345,"it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a",Dracula
345,certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the,Dracula
345,"coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily",Dracula
345,to the same result.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next,Dracula
345,"step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full",Dracula
345,confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be,Dracula
345,"kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful",Dracula
345,"to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of",Dracula
345,"despair. ""There must be no concealment,"" she said, ""Alas! we have had",Dracula
345,too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can,Dracula
345,give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!,Dracula
345,"Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!""",Dracula
345,"Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly",Dracula
345,but quietly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for",Dracula
345,"others from yourself, after what has happened?"" Her face grew set in its",Dracula
345,"lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she",Dracula
345,answered:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah no! for my mind is made up!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""To what?"" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in",Dracula
345,our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer,Dracula
345,"came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of",Dracula
345,"harm to any that I love, I shall die!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You would not kill yourself?"" he asked, hoarsely.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a",Dracula
345,"pain, and so desperate an effort!"" She looked at him meaningly as she",Dracula
345,spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and,Dracula
345,put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I",Dracula
345,"could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,",Dracula
345,"even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my",Dracula
345,"child----"" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his",Dracula
345,throat; he gulped it down and went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not",Dracula
345,die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until,Dracula
345,"the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not",Dracula
345,"die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make",Dracula
345,"you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to",Dracula
345,"live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death",Dracula
345,"himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the",Dracula
345,night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you,Dracula
345,"do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past."" The",Dracula
345,"poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a",Dracula
345,quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all,Dracula
345,silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to,Dracula
345,"him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall",Dracula
345,"strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may",Dracula
345,"have passed away from me."" She was so good and brave that we all felt",Dracula
345,"that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we",Dracula
345,began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all,Dracula
345,"the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we",Dracula
345,might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.,Dracula
345,"She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if ""pleased"" could",Dracula
345,be used in connection with so grim an interest.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was",Dracula
345,prepared with an exact ordering of our work.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is perhaps well,"" he said, ""that at our meeting after our visit to",Dracula
345,Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay,Dracula
345,"there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and",Dracula
345,would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an,Dracula
345,effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our,Dracula
345,"intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a",Dracula
345,"power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use",Dracula
345,them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as,Dracula
345,"to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in",Dracula
345,"Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;",Dracula
345,and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning,Dracula
345,"guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must",Dracula
345,retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations,Dracula
345,of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear,Dracula
345,"through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he",Dracula
345,must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out,Dracula
345,"all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch",Dracula
345,"him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching",Dracula
345,"and the destroying shall be, in time, sure."" Here I started up for I",Dracula
345,could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so,Dracula
345,"preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,",Dracula
345,since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up,Dracula
345,"his hand warningly. ""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" he said, ""in this, the",Dracula
345,"quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all",Dracula
345,"act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in",Dracula
345,all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.,Dracula
345,The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have,Dracula
345,"deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he",Dracula
345,write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings,Dracula
345,"that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,",Dracula
345,"where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the",Dracula
345,very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and,Dracula
345,"search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our",Dracula
345,"friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we",Dracula
345,"run down our old fox--so? is it not?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then let us come at once,"" I cried, ""we are wasting the precious,",Dracula
345,"precious time!"" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Any way!"" I cried. ""We shall break in if need be.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good,Dracula
345,"reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am",Dracula
345,"in.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to",Dracula
345,"your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at",Dracula
345,"movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it",Dracula
345,seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get,Dracula
345,"into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?"" I nodded.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could",Dracula
345,not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the,Dracula
345,"housebreaker, what would you do?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the",Dracula
345,"lock for me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And your police, they would interfere, would they not?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then,"" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, ""all that is in doubt is",Dracula
345,"the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to",Dracula
345,whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your,Dracula
345,"police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading",Dracula
345,"the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my",Dracula
345,"friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this",Dracula
345,"your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such",Dracula
345,"things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,",Dracula
345,no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine,Dracula
345,"house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland",Dracula
345,"and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and",Dracula
345,got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out,Dracula
345,"and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he",Dracula
345,"have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;",Dracula
345,and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of,Dracula
345,"that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him",Dracula
345,"that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away",Dracula
345,within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all,Dracula
345,they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland,Dracula
345,he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done,Dracula
345,_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go,Dracula
345,"so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem",Dracula
345,"it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many",Dracula
345,"about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the",Dracula
345,"house.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's,Dracula
345,face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van,Dracula
345,Helsing went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of",Dracula
345,us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be,Dracula
345,"more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Lord Godalming stood up. ""I can be of some use here,"" he said. ""I shall",Dracula
345,wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most,Dracula
345,"convenient.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look here, old fellow,"" said Morris, ""it is a capital idea to have all",Dracula
345,ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one,Dracula
345,of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of,Dracula
345,Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?,Dracula
345,It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and,Dracula
345,"even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend Quincey is right!"" said the Professor. ""His head is what you",Dracula
345,call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to,Dracula
345,"do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see,Dracula
345,that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the,Dracula
345,"terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost",Dracula
345,"ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in",Dracula
345,"somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give",Dracula
345,her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of,Dracula
345,what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As,Dracula
345,yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet,Dracula
345,"was short, and there was time for fear.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the,Dracula
345,"disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was",Dracula
345,finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the,Dracula
345,"Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we",Dracula
345,should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his,Dracula
345,"presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us",Dracula
345,some new clue.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,",Dracula
345,"after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;",Dracula
345,"that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming",Dracula
345,and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.,Dracula
345,"It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count",Dracula
345,"might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be",Dracula
345,"able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to",Dracula
345,"follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as",Dracula
345,"my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect",Dracula
345,"Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would",Dracula
345,not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter,Dracula
345,in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be,Dracula
345,some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;,Dracula
345,"and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to",Dracula
345,"cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's",Dracula
345,resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that,Dracula
345,"we should all work together. ""As for me,"" she said, ""I have no fear.",Dracula
345,Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must,Dracula
345,"have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if",Dracula
345,"He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present."" So I",Dracula
345,"started up crying out: ""Then in God's name let us come at once, for we",Dracula
345,are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we,Dracula
345,"think.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Not so!"" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why?"" I asked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you forget,"" he said, with actually a smile, ""that last night he",Dracula
345,"banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that,Dracula
345,terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but,Dracula
345,"the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and",Dracula
345,shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her,Dracula
345,frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in,Dracula
345,"the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,",Dracula
345,"he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. ""Oh,",Dracula
345,"Madam Mina,"" he said, ""dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so",Dracula
345,reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old,Dracula
345,lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will,Dracula
345,"forget it, will you not?"" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took",Dracula
345,"his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I",Dracula
345,"have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all",Dracula
345,"together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we",Dracula
345,"must all eat that we may be strong.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and,Dracula
345,"encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of",Dracula
345,"us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we",Dracula
345,"all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's",Dracula
345,"lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?"" We all assured",Dracula
345,"him. ""Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe",Dracula
345,here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall,Dracula
345,return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I,Dracula
345,"have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing",Dracula
345,"of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard",Dracula
345,yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the,Dracula
345,"name of the Father, the Son, and----""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he,Dracula
345,"had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned",Dracula
345,into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor,Dracula
345,darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as,Dracula
345,her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that,Dracula
345,her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the,Dracula
345,words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased,Dracula
345,"to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her",Dracula
345,knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair,Dracula
345,"over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must",Dracula
345,"bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day."" They",Dracula
345,all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless,Dracula
345,"grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our",Dracula
345,"sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away",Dracula
345,their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said,Dracula
345,gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some,Dracula
345,"way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,",Dracula
345,"as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of",Dracula
345,"the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam",Dracula
345,"Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that",Dracula
345,"red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,",Dracula
345,and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as,Dracula
345,"we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the",Dracula
345,"burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did",Dracula
345,in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of,Dracula
345,"His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other",Dracula
345,through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and,Dracula
345,"fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.",Dracula
345,"Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old",Dracula
345,man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all,Dracula
345,"knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each",Dracula
345,other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the,Dracula
345,"head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help",Dracula
345,and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which",Dracula
345,neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a,Dracula
345,"vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible",Dracula
345,land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant,Dracula
345,"many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so",Dracula
345,the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on,Dracula
345,the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic,Dracula
345,surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such,Dracula
345,"fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there",Dracula
345,"not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded",Dracula
345,"with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and",Dracula
345,in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.,Dracula
345,Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this",Dracula
345,"earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far",Dracula
345,distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has,Dracula
345,"been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more",Dracula
345,"holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to",Dracula
345,"God."" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and",Dracula
345,very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled,Dracula
345,"musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention",Dracula
345,was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the,Dracula
345,"Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down",Dracula
345,"the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left",Dracula
345,them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion,Dracula
345,of the Host.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can",Dracula
345,"be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam",Dracula
345,"Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our,Dracula
345,"train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the",Dracula
345,"window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to",Dracula
345,tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in,Dracula
345,"reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her",Dracula
345,hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station,Dracula
345,"and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the",Dracula
345,platform.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I have written this in the train.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street",Dracula
345,Lord Godalming said to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in",Dracula
345,case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it,Dracula
345,wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a,Dracula
345,solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you,Dracula
345,"should have known better."" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger",Dracula
345,"even of odium, but he went on: ""Besides, it will attract less attention",Dracula
345,if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with,Dracula
345,"the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had",Dracula
345,"better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,",Dracula
345,somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and,Dracula
345,"the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the",Dracula
345,"lookout for you, and shall let you in.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The advice is good!"" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming",Dracula
345,"and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner",Dracula
345,of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green,Dracula
345,Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was,Dracula
345,"centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst",Dracula
345,its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench,Dracula
345,"within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little",Dracula
345,attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we,Dracula
345,waited for the coming of the others.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely",Dracula
345,"fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended",Dracula
345,a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid,Dracula
345,"the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two",Dracula
345,"ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.",Dracula
345,The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes,Dracula
345,"of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered",Dracula
345,"along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down",Dracula
345,"placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a",Dracula
345,selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly,Dracula
345,"fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and",Dracula
345,"turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and",Dracula
345,"the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he",Dracula
345,"began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling",Dracula
345,"about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the",Dracula
345,"door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others",Dracula
345,"entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van",Dracula
345,Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the,Dracula
345,workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly,Dracula
345,"open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.",Dracula
345,"This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and",Dracula
345,"gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his",Dracula
345,coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole,Dracula
345,transaction.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at",Dracula
345,"the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood",Dracula
345,Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as we came in. It did",Dracula
345,indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our,Dracula
345,previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the,Dracula
345,"place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together",Dracula
345,in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal,Dracula
345,"with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the",Dracula
345,"house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found",Dracula
345,"eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!",Dracula
345,"Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the",Dracula
345,missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out,Dracula
345,"across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,",Dracula
345,pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no,Dracula
345,"windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not",Dracula
345,lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had,Dracula
345,"brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had",Dracula
345,treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the,Dracula
345,"Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for",Dracula
345,any of his effects.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,",Dracula
345,we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects,Dracula
345,which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine,Dracula
345,them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room,Dracula
345,table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;,Dracula
345,deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;,Dracula
345,"note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin",Dracula
345,wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes,Dracula
345,"brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing",Dracula
345,dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a,Dracula
345,"little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to",Dracula
345,"the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming",Dracula
345,and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the,Dracula
345,"houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great",Dracula
345,"bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us",Dracula
345,"are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of",Dracula
345,the Count.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for,Dracula
345,the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep,Dracula
345,our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent,Dracula
345,"purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.",Dracula
345,The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.,Dracula
345,"Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful",Dracula
345,"face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,",Dracula
345,"haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning",Dracula
345,eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in,Dracula
345,"fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if",Dracula
345,"all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,",Dracula
345,"in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I",Dracula
345,"thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows",Dracula
345,"this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he",Dracula
345,"has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So",Dracula
345,"well as I can remember, here it is:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all",Dracula
345,"the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the",Dracula
345,greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there,Dracula
345,"are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of",Dracula
345,"it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,",Dracula
345,"he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and",Dracula
345,alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the,Dracula
345,"science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond",Dracula
345,"compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to",Dracula
345,"attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time",Dracula
345,"that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the",Dracula
345,physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.,Dracula
345,"In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is",Dracula
345,"growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of",Dracula
345,"man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not",Dracula
345,been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we,Dracula
345,"fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must",Dracula
345,"lead through Death, not Life.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against my darling!",Dracula
345,"But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but",Dracula
345,"surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as",Dracula
345,"yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain",Dracula
345,"things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means",Dracula
345,"to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait",Dracula

345,The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this",Dracula
345,monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been,Dracula
345,making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend,Dracula
345,"John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when",Dracula
345,"and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by",Dracula
345,an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not,Dracula
345,see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He,Dracula
345,knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great,Dracula
345,"child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he",Dracula
345,"might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he",Dracula
345,"found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he",Dracula
345,"progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where",Dracula
345,they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So,Dracula
345,"that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his",Dracula
345,"form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his",Dracula
345,"hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him",Dracula
345,just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;,Dracula
345,and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he,Dracula
345,can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is,Dracula
345,there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even,Dracula
345,"more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be",Dracula
345,"well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our",Dracula
345,"day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are",Dracula
345,"five of us when those absent ones return.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the",Dracula
345,double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the,Dracula
345,"hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to",Dracula
345,"keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a",Dracula
345,"despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the",Dracula
345,"direction, opened it and read aloud.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"" Van Helsing turned to him",Dracula
345,quickly and said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice",Dracula
345,"as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I care for nothing now,"" he answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this",Dracula
345,"brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, hush, hush, my child!"" said Van Helsing. ""God does not purchase",Dracula
345,"souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep",Dracula
345,"faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your",Dracula
345,"devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be",Dracula
345,"doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are",Dracula
345,"all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is",Dracula
345,"coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,",Dracula
345,and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive,Dracula
345,"here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times",Dracula
345,"before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for",Dracula
345,"is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there",Dracula
345,"came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary",Dracula
345,"knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made",Dracula
345,"the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and",Dracula
345,together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various,Dracula
345,"armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood",Dracula
345,"back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts",Dracula
345,"must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we",Dracula
345,saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed,Dracula
345,"the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the",Dracula
345,hall:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we",Dracula
345,"destroyed them all!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Destroyed?"" asked the Professor.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""For him!"" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up",Dracula
345,"by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker",Dracula
345,"alone after sunset.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He will be here before long now,"" said Van Helsing, who had been",Dracula
345,"consulting his pocket-book. ""_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went",Dracula
345,"south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could",Dracula
345,"only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one",Dracula
345,o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only,Dracula
345,suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would,Dracula
345,suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a,Dracula
345,short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to,Dracula
345,Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be,Dracula
345,"carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not",Dracula
345,"have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that",Dracula
345,"we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your",Dracula
345,"arms! Be ready!"" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could",Dracula
345,hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a",Dracula
345,dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and,Dracula
345,"adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always",Dracula
345,"been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been",Dracula
345,"accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be",Dracula
345,"renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once",Dracula
345,"laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a",Dracula
345,"gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were",Dracula
345,"just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could",Dracula
345,guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.,Dracula
345,Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to,Dracula
345,move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the,Dracula
345,"seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along",Dracula
345,the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least,Dracula
345,he feared it.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past",Dracula
345,us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something,Dracula
345,"so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed",Dracula
345,to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was,Dracula
345,"Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door",Dracula
345,"leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a",Dracula
345,"horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long",Dracula
345,and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of,Dracula
345,"lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single",Dracula
345,"impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some",Dracula
345,"better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what",Dracula
345,we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would,Dracula
345,"avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had",Dracula
345,ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The,Dracula
345,blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's,Dracula
345,leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne,Dracula
345,"through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,",Dracula
345,making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold,Dracula
345,"fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a",Dracula
345,"moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife",Dracula
345,aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a,Dracula
345,"protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I",Dracula
345,felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I,Dracula
345,saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously,Dracula
345,by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of,Dracula
345,hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over,Dracula
345,the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast,Dracula
345,"of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the",Dracula
345,"pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous",Dracula
345,"dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping",Dracula
345,"a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw",Dracula
345,"himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,",Dracula
345,he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the,Dracula
345,"shivering glass I could hear the ""ting"" of the gold, as some of the",Dracula
345,sovereigns fell on the flagging.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up",Dracula
345,"the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.",Dracula
345,There he turned and spoke to us:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like",Dracula
345,"sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think",Dracula
345,you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is,Dracula
345,"just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your",Dracula
345,girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and,Dracula
345,"others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my",Dracula
345,"jackals when I want to feed. Bah!"" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed",Dracula
345,"quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he",Dracula
345,fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us,Dracula
345,"to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following",Dracula
345,"him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he",Dracula
345,"fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His",Dracula
345,"very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You",Dracula
345,"follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For",Dracula
345,"me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he",Dracula
345,"return."" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took",Dracula
345,"the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the",Dracula
345,"remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with",Dracula
345,a match.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had",Dracula
345,"lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,",Dracula
345,bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there,Dracula
345,was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back,Dracula
345,of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to",Dracula
345,recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the,Dracula
345,Professor when he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do",Dracula
345,"just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need",Dracula
345,"not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find",Dracula
345,"it; when that is done all may yet be well."" I could see that he spoke as",Dracula
345,bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken,Dracula
345,down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he,Dracula
345,was thinking of his wife.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker",Dracula
345,"waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her",Dracula
345,"bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as",Dracula
345,pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were,Dracula
345,in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!"" As she spoke,",Dracula
345,"she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--""Lay your",Dracula
345,"poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect",Dracula
345,"us if He so will it in His good intent."" The poor fellow groaned. There",Dracula
345,was no place for words in his sublime misery.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us",Dracula
345,"all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry",Dracula
345,people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense,Dracula
345,of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less,Dracula
345,"miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to",Dracula
345,"our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and",Dracula
345,although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to,Dracula
345,"threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was",Dracula
345,"manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the",Dracula
345,"part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to",Dracula
345,"her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could",Dracula
345,"protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,",Dracula
345,"till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up",Dracula
345,to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she,Dracula
345,"stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the",Dracula
345,"scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty",Dracula
345,"of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which",Dracula
345,"she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our",Dracula
345,teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against,Dracula
345,our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and,Dracula
345,"we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and",Dracula
345,"purity and faith, was outcast from God.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jonathan,"" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was",Dracula
345,"so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan dear, and you all my true,",Dracula
345,"true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this",Dracula
345,dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as,Dracula
345,you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;,Dracula
345,but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this,Dracula
345,misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when,Dracula
345,"he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have",Dracula
345,"spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may",Dracula
345,"not hold your hands from his destruction.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as",Dracula
345,though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.,Dracula
345,"Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his",Dracula
345,knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she,Dracula
345,"must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing",Dracula
345,"than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing",Dracula
345,his hand from hers as he spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that",Dracula
345,earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send,Dracula
345,"his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,",Dracula
345,"Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just",Dracula
345,"think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that",Dracula
345,"... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some",Dracula
345,"other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,",Dracula
345,"my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought",Dracula
345,had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured,Dracula
345,"your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and",Dracula
345,"sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence",Dracula
345,"of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom",Dracula
345,"so many sorrows have come.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept",Dracula
345,"openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.",Dracula
345,"Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms",Dracula
345,"round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned",Dracula
345,"to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone",Dracula
345,with their God.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming,Dracula
345,"of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.",Dracula
345,"She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her",Dracula
345,"husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,",Dracula
345,"I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at",Dracula
345,hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.,Dracula
345,"When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should",Dracula
345,"sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the",Dracula
345,"poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us",Dracula
345,"shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,",Dracula
345,"for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go",Dracula

345,"_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.",Dracula
345,"There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief",Dracula
345,"that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must",Dracula
345,"now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step",Dracula
345,"was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one",Dracula
345,"earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he",Dracula
345,"chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the",Dracula
345,"meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.",Dracula
345,"This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that",Dracula
345,one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her,Dracula
345,"sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster",Dracula
345,seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer,Dracula
345,by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting,Dracula
345,"reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is",Dracula

345,"like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so",Dracula
345,"calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came",Dracula
345,over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.,Dracula
345,I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her,Dracula
345,"face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy",Dracula

345,"""Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,",Dracula
345,"we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!"" Then",Dracula
345,"turning to her, he said, cheerfully: ""And what am I do for you? For at",Dracula
345,"this hour you do not want me for nothings.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I want you to hypnotise me!"" she said. ""Do it before the dawn, for I",Dracula
345,"feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is",Dracula
345,"short!"" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,",Dracula
345,"from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina",Dracula
345,"gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat",Dracula
345,"like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually",Dracula
345,"her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of",Dracula
345,her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few,Dracula
345,"more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was",Dracula
345,covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she,Dracula
345,"did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and",Dracula
345,her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to,Dracula
345,"impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.",Dracula
345,"They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the",Dracula
345,"foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The",Dracula
345,stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone,Dracula
345,which would not break the current of her thoughts:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Where are you?"" The answer came in a neutral way:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own."" For several",Dracula
345,"minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood",Dracula
345,staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room,Dracula
345,"was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van",Dracula
345,"Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed",Dracula
345,"just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse",Dracula
345,itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Where are you now?"" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it",Dracula
345,were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the,Dracula
345,same tone when reading her shorthand notes.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I do not know. It is all strange to me!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What do you see?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I can see nothing; it is all dark.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What do you hear?"" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient",Dracula
345,voice.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can",Dracula
345,"hear them on the outside.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then you are on a ship?"" We all looked at each other, trying to glean",Dracula
345,something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came,Dracula
345,quick:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, yes!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What else do you hear?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the",Dracula
345,"creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan",Dracula
345,"falls into the rachet.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What are you doing?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!"" The voice faded away into",Dracula
345,"a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of",Dracula
345,"day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her",Dracula
345,head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few,Dracula
345,"moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see",Dracula
345,"us all around her. ""Have I been talking in my sleep?"" was all she said.",Dracula
345,"She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she",Dracula
345,was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the,Dracula
345,"conversation, and she said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!"" Mr.",Dracula
345,Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm,Dracula
345,voice called them back:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor",Dracula
345,whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in,Dracula
345,your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be,Dracula
345,"thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we",Dracula
345,"know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,",Dracula
345,since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking,Dracula
345,"forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but",Dracula
345,that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the,Dracula
345,"Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce",Dracula
345,knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear,Dracula
345,"me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men",Dracula
345,"following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He",Dracula
345,"have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He",Dracula
345,"think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would",Dracula
345,"say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and",Dracula
345,"we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a",Dracula
345,"little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters",Dracula
345,"between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he",Dracula
345,"would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or",Dracula
345,"slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to",Dracula
345,"us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,",Dracula
345,and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with,Dracula
345,"us."" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"" He",Dracula
345,took her hand and patted it as he replied:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all",Dracula
345,"questions."" He would say no more, and we separated to dress.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for,Dracula
345,a minute and then said sorrowfully:--,Dracula

345,"even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!"" She grew paler as",Dracula

345,"to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of",Dracula

345,that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the,Dracula

345,certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;,Dracula
345,"and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible",Dracula
345,"danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to",Dracula

345,there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will,Dracula
345,"keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to,Dracula
345,discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that",Dracula
345,"he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since",Dracula
345,by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne,Dracula
345,ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what,Dracula
345,"ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since",Dracula
345,Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in,Dracula
345,"your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of",Dracula
345,"Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,",Dracula
345,however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go,Dracula
345,"out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from",Dracula
345,"Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the",Dracula
345,"Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off",Dracula
345,"we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood",Dracula
345,so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire,Dracula
345,"of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face",Dracula
345,"and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey",Dracula
345,"give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and",Dracula
345,"put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he",Dracula
345,"still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask",Dracula
345,many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they,Dracula
345,"have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of",Dracula
345,"others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but",Dracula
345,nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five",Dracula
345,"o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose",Dracula
345,"and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in",Dracula
345,"black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the",Dracula
345,time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship,Dracula
345,sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and,Dracula
345,"then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of",Dracula
345,"gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when",Dracula
345,told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he,Dracula
345,agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse,Dracula
345,"and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself",Dracula
345,"driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it",Dracula
345,take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to,Dracula
345,captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like,Dracula
345,"it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he",Dracula
345,can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not,Dracula
345,"yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he",Dracula
345,had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the,Dracula
345,place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin,Dracula
345,man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he,Dracula
345,"will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,",Dracula
345,"polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he",Dracula
345,will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the,Dracula
345,"sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell",Dracula
345,him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also,Dracula
345,"with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking",Dracula
345,where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship,Dracula
345,"forms, he departed.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for",Dracula
345,they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon,Dracula
345,became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as,Dracula
345,"was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,",Dracula
345,and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.,Dracula
345,The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and,Dracula
345,blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to,Dracula
345,"fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,",Dracula
345,"when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and",Dracula
345,asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied,Dracula
345,that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and,Dracula
345,"blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down",Dracula
345,"with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile",Dracula
345,"on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.",Dracula
345,"Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and",Dracula
345,all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was,Dracula
345,"of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears",Dracula
345,"exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of",Dracula
345,"picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up",Dracula
345,"and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any",Dracula
345,"of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship",Dracula
345,went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the,Dracula
345,"river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for",Dracula
345,"our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the",Dracula
345,"Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when",Dracula
345,"we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope",Dracula
345,is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then,Dracula
345,"he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There",Dracula
345,"are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about",Dracula
345,"where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us",Dracula
345,invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in,Dracula
345,"Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present",Dracula
345,his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.,Dracula
345,"When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and",Dracula
345,"have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not",Dracula
345,for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own,Dracula
345,"way.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain",Dracula
345,"that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: ""We have the",Dracula
345,"best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this",Dracula
345,"morning."" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should",Dracula
345,"pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that",Dracula
345,"he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,",Dracula
345,"at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more",Dracula
345,"forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some",Dracula
345,of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst,Dracula
345,men:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,",Dracula
345,and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm,Dracula
345,"already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short",Dracula
345,time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in,Dracula
345,"darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my",Dracula
345,"dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or",Dracula
345,in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his,Dracula
345,own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life,Dracula
345,"of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the",Dracula
345,"work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do",Dracula
345,"what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have",Dracula
345,"been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of",Dracula
345,nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in,Dracula
345,"some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for",Dracula
345,"all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical",Dracula
345,world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.,Dracula
345,"There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters",Dracula
345,"of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,",Dracula
345,there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of,Dracula
345,occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in,Dracula
345,himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike,Dracula
345,"time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,",Dracula
345,"more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in",Dracula
345,strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and,Dracula
345,"thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which",Dracula
345,"is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,",Dracula
345,"and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have",Dracula
345,"infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for",Dracula
345,"good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do",Dracula
345,"no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and",Dracula
345,"so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,",Dracula
345,shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together,Dracula
345,that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the,Dracula
345,"world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,",Dracula
345,whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one,Dracula
345,"soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem",Dracula
345,"more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if",Dracula
345,"we fall, we fall in good cause."" He paused and I said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven",Dracula
345,"from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from",Dracula
345,"which he has been hunted?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Aha!"" he said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall",Dracula
345,"adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once",Dracula
345,"tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl",Dracula
345,unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a,Dracula
345,"tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he",Dracula
345,"is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go",Dracula
345,over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be,Dracula
345,"beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.",Dracula
345,Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to,Dracula
345,him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What,Dracula
345,does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for,Dracula
345,him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He,Dracula
345,"find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He",Dracula
345,study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old,Dracula
345,"ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new",Dracula
345,land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that,Dracula

345,him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at,Dracula
345,the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a,Dracula
345,ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater,Dracula
345,"world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know",Dracula
345,him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole,Dracula
345,"peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,",Dracula
345,what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we,Dracula
345,"are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our",Dracula
345,"efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not",Dracula
345,"even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest",Dracula
345,"strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons",Dracula
345,"to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls",Dracula
345,"for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the",Dracula
345,"honour and glory of God.""",Dracula

345,After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing,Dracula
345,"be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to",Dracula
345,"think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to",Dracula
345,"meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we",Dracula
345,shall decide on some definite cause of action.,Dracula

345,I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting,Dracula

345,,Dracula

345,_Dr. Seward's Diary._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for",Dracula
345,each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more,Dracula
345,general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience,Dracula
345,again.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let,Dracula
345,"any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by",Dracula
345,death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More,Dracula
345,"than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether",Dracula
345,the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I,Dracula
345,caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was,Dracula
345,"brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the",Dracula
345,"matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our",Dracula
345,trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her,Dracula
345,"trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something",Dracula
345,"recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to",Dracula
345,meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of,Dracula
345,"action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct",Dracula
345,rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear,Dracula
345,that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_,Dracula
345,"that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can",Dracula
345,"guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or",Dracula
345,"cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and",Dracula
345,he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of,Dracula
345,that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The,Dracula
345,"Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called ""the",Dracula
345,"Vampire's baptism of blood."" Well, there may be a poison that distils",Dracula
345,itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is,Dracula
345,a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my,Dracula
345,"instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a",Dracula
345,terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same,Dracula
345,power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think,Dracula
345,further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall,Dracula
345,try to open the subject with him.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of",Dracula
345,things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to,Dracula
345,"say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating",Dracula
345,"about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just",Dracula
345,"at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our",Dracula
345,"confidence""; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing."" A cold shiver ran",Dracula
345,through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing,Dracula
345,continued:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned",Dracula
345,before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than,Dracula
345,"ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I",Dracula
345,can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now,Dracula
345,"but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice",Dracula
345,"without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes",Dracula
345,"are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now",Dracula
345,"often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she",Dracula
345,wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If,Dracula
345,"it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and",Dracula
345,"hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who",Dracula
345,"have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he",Dracula
345,"will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?"" I nodded",Dracula
345,acquiescence; he went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of",Dracula
345,"our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful",Dracula
345,"task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.",Dracula
345,"When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not",Dracula
345,"to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by",Dracula
345,"us."" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration",Dracula
345,at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor,Dracula
345,soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort,Dracula
345,to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at,Dracula
345,"any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the",Dracula
345,effect was as I expected.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has,Dracula
345,"gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I",Dracula
345,really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was,Dracula
345,experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a,Dracula
345,"message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as",Dracula
345,she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements,Dracula
345,without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each,Dracula
345,"other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own",Dracula
345,"part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was",Dracula
345,much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we,Dracula
345,"agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to",Dracula
345,"preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to",Dracula
345,confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van,Dracula
345,Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take",Dracula
345,her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to,Dracula
345,reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.,Dracula
345,"Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such",Dracula
345,weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if,Dracula
345,"we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,",Dracula
345,"then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite",Dracula
345,"safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate",Dracula
345,"be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such",Dracula
345,preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed,Dracula
345,"against evil things, spiritual as well as physical."" Here Quincey Morris",Dracula
345,added:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be",Dracula
345,that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to,Dracula
345,our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any,Dracula
345,"trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack",Dracula
345,after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater,Dracula
345,"apiece!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good!"" said Van Helsing, ""Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is",Dracula
345,"level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more",Dracula
345,dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we,Dracula
345,can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of,Dracula
345,"us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.",Dracula
345,"To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we",Dracula
345,"four can set out on our journey.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We four?"" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of",Dracula
345,us.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Of course!"" answered the Professor quickly, ""you must remain to take",Dracula
345,"care of your so sweet wife!"" Harker was silent for awhile and then said",Dracula
345,in a hollow voice:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with",Dracula
345,"Mina."" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not",Dracula
345,to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him,Dracula
345,significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and,Dracula
345,turned away.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Jonathan Harker's Journal._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I",Dracula
345,could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of,Dracula
345,wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not,Dracula
345,to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not,Dracula
345,"argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from",Dracula
345,"a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the",Dracula
345,last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no,Dracula
345,"more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly",Dracula
345,and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams,Dracula
345,"with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and",Dracula
345,came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the,Dracula
345,"evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking",Dracula
345,"lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at",Dracula
345,"once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A",Dracula
345,"promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be",Dracula
345,broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter,Dracula
345,"tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Mina,"" I said, ""a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have",Dracula
345,"no right to make it.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But, dear one,"" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes",Dracula
345,"were like pole stars, ""it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.",Dracula
345,You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may,Dracula
345,"do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved",Dracula
345,"from the promise.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I promise!"" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though",Dracula
345,to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.,Dracula
345,She said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for",Dracula
345,"the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or",Dracula
345,"implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!"" and she",Dracula
345,"solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said",Dracula
345,solemnly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I promise!"" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had",Dracula
345,been shut between us.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,       *       *       *       *       *,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.",Dracula
345,"So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected",Dracula
345,somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall,Dracula
345,of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired,Dracula
345,early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing,Dracula
345,that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible,Dracula
345,"trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.",Dracula
345,Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall,Dracula
345,try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the",Dracula
345,"same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought",Dracula
345,"that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went",Dracula
345,"for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found",Dracula
345,"him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the",Dracula
345,opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the,Dracula
345,"room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No,"" she said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary. You can tell",Dracula
345,"them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he,Dracula
345,asked:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,",Dracula
345,"too.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest",Dracula
345,"duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than",Dracula
345,"any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been."" He paused,",Dracula
345,embarrassed.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is",Dracula
345,coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me,Dracula
345,"I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by",Dracula
345,"wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan."" God saw the look that",Dracula
345,"she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel",Dracula
345,that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her,Dracula
345,hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of,Dracula
345,tears. She went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you",Dracula
345,can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had,Dracula
345,"to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me",Dracula
345,"and so learn that which even I myself do not know."" Dr. Van Helsing said",Dracula
345,very gravely:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and",Dracula
345,"together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve."" When he had",Dracula
345,"spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen",Dracula
345,back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up,Dracula
345,the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing,Dracula
345,"motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within",Dracula
345,"a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.",Dracula
345,"He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a",Dracula
345,"new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony",Dracula
345,"to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are",Dracula
345,"warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be",Dracula
345,"ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What shall we do exactly?"" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor",Dracula
345,paused before replying:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified",Dracula
345,"the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall",Dracula
345,"fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the",Dracula
345,superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was,Dracula
345,"man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,",Dracula
345,"when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we",Dracula
345,"shall open the box, and--and all will be well.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I shall not wait for any opportunity,"" said Morris. ""When I see the box",Dracula
345,"I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand",Dracula
345,"men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!"" I",Dracula
345,grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.,Dracula
345,I think he understood my look; I hope he did.,Dracula

345,"_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he",Dracula
345,"says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.,Dracula
345,Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to,Dracula
345,understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;,Dracula
345,when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing,Dracula
345,"or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition",Dracula
345,"begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts",Dracula
345,"till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with",Dracula
345,the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of,Dracula
345,"negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute",Dracula
345,"freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the",Dracula
345,"change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of",Dracula
345,warning silence.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the",Dracula
345,signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a,Dracula
345,violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few,Dracula
345,"minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning",Dracula
345,"her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,",Dracula
345,she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand,Dracula
345,in hers began:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,",Dracula
345,"dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end."" This was to",Dracula
345,"her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. ""In",Dracula
345,"the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in",Dracula
345,store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me,Dracula
345,with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak,Dracula

345,"did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing",Dracula

345,"silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The",Dracula
345,faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""This is what I can give into the hotch-pot."" I could not but note the",Dracula
345,"quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all",Dracula

345,"can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?"" She looked",Dracula
345,"again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey",Dracula
345,"seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. ""Then I shall tell",Dracula
345,"you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""And I!"" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to",Dracula
345,"take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her",Dracula
345,wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,"all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all",Dracula
345,"time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed",Dracula
345,"their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the",Dracula
345,hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because,Dracula
345,those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty,Dracula

345,wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to,Dracula
345,"hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he",Dracula
345,"had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by",Dracula
345,"habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at",Dracula
345,"these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing",Dracula

345,"It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on",Dracula

345,that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from,Dracula
345,anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should,Dracula
345,send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He,Dracula

345,We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the,Dracula

345,"on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the",Dracula
345,"form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and",Dracula
345,so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without,Dracula
345,suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the,Dracula
345,"box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;",Dracula
345,"for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,",Dracula
345,before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for,Dracula

345,"seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,",Dracula
345,and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the,Dracula

345,"a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own",Dracula
345,risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every,Dracula
345,"facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a",Dracula
345,"similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who",Dracula
345,"was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all",Dracula
345,satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We,Dracula
345,have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the,Dracula

345,drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall,Dracula
345,"prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall",Dracula

345,"Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After",Dracula

345,"let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any",Dracula
345,"excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am",Dracula
345,"sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but",Dracula

345,"""Wonderful woman!"" murmured the Professor.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Can't we get a special?"" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his",Dracula
345,"head: ""I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even",Dracula
345,"if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our",Dracula
345,"regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.",Dracula
345,"Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the",Dracula
345,tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do,Dracula
345,"you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him",Dracula
345,"letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship",Dracula
345,"just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get",Dracula
345,his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way,Dracula
345,"smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay",Dracula
345,"with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you",Dracula
345,"may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here",Dracula
345,"with Madam to make report.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""And I,"" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she",Dracula
345,"had been for many a long day, ""shall try to be of use in all ways, and",Dracula
345,shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting,Dracula
345,"from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!""",Dracula
345,The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to,Dracula
345,"realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to",Dracula
345,"each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the",Dracula
345,"time, however.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.,Dracula
345,Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of,Dracula
345,Harker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door,Dracula
345,was shut upon her he said to me:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We mean the same! speak out!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may",Dracula
345,"deceive us.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No!"" said I, ""unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell",Dracula
345,"you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;",Dracula
345,but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those,Dracula
345,"words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In",Dracula
345,the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her,Dracula
345,mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship,Dracula
345,"with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn",Dracula
345,then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with,Dracula
345,"eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.",Dracula
345,Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;",Dracula
345,"but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that",Dracula
345,so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that,Dracula
345,"have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will",Dracula
345,"come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,",Dracula
345,"that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and",Dracula
345,therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!,Dracula
345,She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when,Dracula
345,"we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great",Dracula
345,"brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have",Dracula
345,"a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away",Dracula
345,"altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall",Dracula
345,"learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never",Dracula
345,"feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,",Dracula
345,"just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled",Dracula
345,himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into,Dracula
345,"the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly",Dracula
345,"forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets",Dracula
345,"of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face",Dracula
345,brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and,Dracula
345,thumb he said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,",Dracula
345,"dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to",Dracula
345,"think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to",Dracula
345,"let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to",Dracula
345,where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought,Dracula
345,"at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet",Dracula
345,"strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the ""Ugly Duck"" of my friend",Dracula
345,"Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that",Dracula
345,"sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I",Dracula
345,read here what Jonathan have written:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought",Dracula
345,"his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was",Dracula
345,"beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come",Dracula
345,"alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,",Dracula
345,"since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought see",Dracula
345,nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my,Dracula
345,"man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word",Dracula
345,"from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what",Dracula
345,"it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,",Dracula
345,yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then,Dracula
345,"pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill",Dracula
345,and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and,Dracula
345,"leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever",Dracula
345,"study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is",Dracula
345,"a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not",Dracula
345,"but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad",Dracula
345,"universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,",Dracula
345,"in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much",Dracula
345,"from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to",Dracula
345,be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true,Dracula
345,"criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.",Dracula
345,This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and,Dracula
345,resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of,Dracula
345,child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime,Dracula
345,"also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he",Dracula
345,"have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not",Dracula
345,"by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to",Dracula
345,"him the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said",Dracula
345,"Archimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,",Dracula
345,is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have,Dracula
345,"the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,",Dracula
345,"just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are",Dracula
345,"opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,"" for",Dracula
345,Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with",Dracula
345,"those so bright eyes."" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.",Dracula
345,"His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and",Dracula
345,"unconsciously, as she spoke:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would",Dracula
345,"so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.",Dracula
345,"Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a",Dracula
345,"clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own",Dracula
345,"lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a",Dracula
345,"'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had",Dracula
345,"tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself",Dracula
345,for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.,Dracula
345,"So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all",Dracula
345,"hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over",Dracula
345,the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube,Dracula
345,"from Turkey Land.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!"" said Van Helsing,",Dracula
345,"enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he",Dracula
345,"said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room",Dracula
345,consultation:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope."" Turning to",Dracula
345,"her again, he said with keen expectation:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;",Dracula
345,"John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.",Dracula
345,"Speak, without fear!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small",Dracula
345,"and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one",Dracula
345,"purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,",Dracula
345,"leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being",Dracula
345,"safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat",Dracula
345,from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful,Dracula
345,"night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul",Dracula
345,is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me,Dracula
345,is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for,Dracula
345,"his ends."" The Professor stood up:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,",Dracula
345,whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to,Dracula
345,"Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.",Dracula
345,"But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in",Dracula
345,"God's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for",Dracula
345,"his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken",Dracula
345,"in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he",Dracula
345,"is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so",Dracula
345,"many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to",Dracula
345,"sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,",Dracula
345,there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That,Dracula
345,terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him,Dracula
345,"in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the",Dracula
345,sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;,Dracula
345,"and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your",Dracula
345,suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know,Dracula
345,"it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his",Dracula
345,"knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe",Dracula
345,"that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark",Dracula
345,hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril,Dracula
345,"ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great",Dracula
345,hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe,Dracula
345,"and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work",Dracula
345,"you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.""",Dracula

345,DR. SEWARD'S DIARY,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last,Dracula
345,night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us,Dracula
345,"had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,",Dracula
345,"and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and",Dracula
345,for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.,Dracula
345,Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and,Dracula
345,more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually,Dracula
345,"necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but",Dracula
345,"this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty",Dracula
345,"resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a",Dracula
345,steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear,Dracula
345,"men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in",Dracula
345,the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.,Dracula
345,"There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged",Dracula
345,along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air,Dracula
345,"blowing upon me.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay",Dracula
345,"on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a",Dracula
345,weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.,Dracula
345,"Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst",Dracula
345,Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There,Dracula
345,was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was,Dracula
345,passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she,Dracula
345,"sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!"" We",Dracula
345,"could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get",Dracula
345,tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his",Dracula
345,earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie,Dracula
345,"hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do",Dracula
345,"not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be",Dracula
345,"in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did",Dracula
345,"at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he",Dracula
345,"be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men",Dracula
345,"may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on",Dracula
345,"shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.",Dracula
345,We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come,Dracula
345,"on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his",Dracula
345,"true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;",Dracula
345,at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her",Dracula
345,response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming,Dracula
345,than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was,Dracula
345,so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole,Dracula
345,"soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made",Dracula
345,reply:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as",Dracula
345,"of wood on wood."" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till",Dracula
345,to-night.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of,Dracula
345,expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;,Dracula
345,"but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot",Dracula
345,possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more,Dracula
345,hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw,Dracula
345,more light on what is happening.,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when,Dracula
345,there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a,Dracula
345,"station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.",Dracula
345,Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than,Dracula
345,this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's,Dracula
345,"sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that",Dracula
345,her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance,Dracula
345,hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes,Dracula
345,on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power,Dracula
345,over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be,Dracula
345,a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did,Dracula
345,"speak, her words were enigmatical:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can",Dracula
345,"hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,",Dracula
345,"fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves."" She stopped and a",Dracula
345,"shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,",Dracula
345,"till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even",Dracula
345,in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from,Dracula
345,"the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was",Dracula
345,"all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;",Dracula
345,"when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in",Dracula
345,silence.,Dracula
345,,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time",Dracula
345,to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.,Dracula
345,"Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,",Dracula
345,Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no,Dracula
345,"effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still",Dracula
345,"greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor",Dracula
345,lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the",Dracula
345,"creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a",Dracula
345,"queer one like----"" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!"" said Van Helsing in an agonised",Dracula
345,"voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun",Dracula
345,"was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and we",Dracula
345,"all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost",Dracula
345,unconcern:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember",Dracula
345,"anything."" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,",Dracula
345,turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was",Dracula
345,"lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!'",Dracula
345,"It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad",Dracula
345,"child!""",Dracula

345,"till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could",Dracula
345,we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we,Dracula
345,"came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we",Dracula
345,never were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail,Dracula
345,"and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the",Dracula
345,"Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it",Dracula
345,whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our,Dracula
345,"miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who",Dracula
345,had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no,Dracula
345,"hinderin' him."" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition",Dracula
345,"and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and",Dracula
345,"he know when he meet his match!"" The skipper was not displeased with the",Dracula
345,"compliment, and went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,",Dracula
345,"the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had",Dracula
345,been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started,Dracula
345,"frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa",Dracula
345,"fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the",Dracula
345,supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot,Dracula
345,their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I,Dracula
345,"felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was",Dracula
345,"agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for",Dracula
345,five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get,Dracula
345,"somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,",Dracula
345,"we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and",Dracula
345,"deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came",Dracula
345,"through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.",Dracula
345,"The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the",Dracula
345,box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a,Dracula
345,handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in,Dracula
345,"his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the",Dracula
345,property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the,Dracula
345,"river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to",Dracula
345,"fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it",Dracula
345,lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We,Dracula
345,"didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;",Dracula
345,"but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came",Dracula
345,"aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box",Dracula
345,marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to,Dracula
345,"his hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the",Dracula
345,"dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil",Dracula
345,"did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither",Dracula
345,"than that same!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""What was the name of the man who took it?"" asked Dr. Van Helsing with",Dracula
345,restrained eagerness.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I'll be tellin' ye quick!"" he answered, and, stepping down to his",Dracula
345,"cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel Hildesheim."" Burgen-strasse",Dracula
345,16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so,Dracula
345,with thanks we came away.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi",Dracula
345,"Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were",Dracula
345,pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little,Dracula
345,bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but,Dracula
345,"important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling",Dracula
345,"him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box",Dracula
345,which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to,Dracula
345,"give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks",Dracula
345,who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by,Dracula
345,"an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube",Dracula
345,"International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to",Dracula
345,"the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all",Dracula
345,he knew.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his",Dracula
345,"neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had",Dracula
345,"gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by",Dracula
345,"his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house",Dracula
345,"together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten",Dracula
345,and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that,Dracula
345,the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of,Dracula
345,"St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild",Dracula
345,"animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the",Dracula
345,"women crying out ""This is the work of a Slovak!"" We hurried away lest we",Dracula
345,"should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all,Dracula
345,"convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where",Dracula
345,that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home,Dracula
345,to the hotel to Mina.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina",Dracula
345,"again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at",Dracula
345,"least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was",Dracula
345,released from my promise to her.,Dracula

345,_Mina Harker's Memorandum._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,(Entered in her Journal.),Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own,Dracula
345,place.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he,Dracula
345,"power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,",Dracula
345,"or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or",Dracula
345,"interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined",Dracula
345,as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help,Dracula
345,"us. By road, by rail, by water?",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the",Dracula
345,city.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,",Dracula
345,"a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order,Dracula
345,"to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even",Dracula
345,his victim--me!,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to,Dracula
345,"take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies",Dracula
345,"on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if",Dracula
345,left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not,Dracula
345,what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most",Dracula
345,danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even,Dracula
345,then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were,Dracula
345,"he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would",Dracula
345,indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were,Dracula
345,"unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would",Dracula
345,still be desperate.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do,Dracula
345,is to ascertain _what_ water.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,",Dracula
345,"then, get a light on what his later task is to be.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part,Dracula
345,"of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had",Dracula
345,to arrange as best he could.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we",Dracula
345,"know of, what he has done here.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent",Dracula
345,invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of,Dracula
345,exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.,Dracula
345,"The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel",Dracula
345,Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is,Dracula
345,also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but,Dracula
345,"there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to",Dracula
345,Hildesheim.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_",Dracula
345,made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's,Dracula
345,suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness,Dracula
345,"played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind",Dracula
345,through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the,Dracula
345,"Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared",Dracula
345,"the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here",Dracula
345,"we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,",Dracula
345,"moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been",Dracula
345,avoided.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on,Dracula
345,"land_, at Galatz.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could,Dracula
345,"appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to",Dracula
345,"aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing",Dracula
345,with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's,Dracula
345,"remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general",Dracula
345,feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his",Dracula
345,"castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from",Dracula
345,"the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks",Dracula
345,"who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.",Dracula
345,Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this,Dracula
345,"service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he",Dracula
345,"came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to",Dracula
345,"arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and",Dracula
345,"he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,",Dracula
345,by murdering his agent.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the,Dracula
345,Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in,Dracula
345,the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling,Dracula
345,"level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,",Dracula
345,was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or,Dracula
345,"poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There",Dracula
345,would be no such sound if floating down stream.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may",Dracula
345,"possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more",Dracula
345,"easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza",Dracula
345,which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as,Dracula
345,close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.,Dracula

345,"him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he",Dracula
345,"is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry",Dracula
345,him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw,Dracula
345,"him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,",Dracula

345,"shall do.""",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"""Good!"" said the Professor, ""both good. But neither must go alone. There",Dracula
345,must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and,Dracula
345,"rough, and he carries rude arms."" All the men smiled, for amongst them",Dracula
345,they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and",Dracula
345,"there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other",Dracula
345,precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could,Dracula
345,"not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points."" Dr.",Dracula
345,Seward said:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt",Dracula

345,"along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the",Dracula
345,"Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry",Dracula
345,"guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we",Dracula
345,"shall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and",Dracula
345,"we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate."" He looked at Jonathan as he",Dracula
345,"spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was",Dracula
345,torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the,Dracula
345,"boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...",Dracula
345,the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was,Dracula
345,"silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you",Dracula
345,"are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the",Dracula
345,last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has,Dracula
345,wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she,Dracula
345,"will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as",Dracula
345,"once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to",Dracula
345,fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in,Dracula
345,"other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let",Dracula
345,"me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and",Dracula
345,"friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and",Dracula
345,whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be,Dracula
345,"landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's",Dracula
345,"country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running",Dracula
345,stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid,Dracula
345,of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to,Dracula
345,"perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz",Dracula
345,"over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam",Dracula
345,"Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all",Dracula
345,dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near,Dracula
345,"that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be",Dracula
345,"made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated."" Here",Dracula
345,Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,",Dracula
345,"in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right",Dracula
345,into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or,Dracula
345,"Hell!"" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish",Dracula
345,"infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every",Dracula
345,speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?,Dracula
345,"Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?"" Here he turned to",Dracula
345,"me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:",Dracula
345,"""Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!"" and he sank",Dracula
345,"down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he",Dracula
345,"spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed",Dracula
345,us all:--,Dracula

345,"""Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful",Dracula
345,place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that,Dracula
345,"place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not",Dracula
345,"see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what",Dracula
345,is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in,Dracula
345,terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and,Dracula
345,"subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then",Dracula
345,"in time our dear one""--he took my hand--""would come to him to keep him",Dracula

345,told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they,Dracula
345,clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and,Dracula
345,"well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is",Dracula
345,"necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,",Dracula
345,"possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,",Dracula
345,"it is I who would have to go to keep them company.""",Dracula

345,"so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!",Dracula
345,What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do,Dracula
345,"when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and",Dracula

345,_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace,Dracula
345,door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an,Dracula
345,"experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his",Dracula
345,"own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our",Dracula
345,"plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any",Dracula
345,"waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the",Dracula
345,"Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took",Dracula
345,"it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the",Dracula
345,place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the,Dracula
345,Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at,Dracula
345,"night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to",Dracula
345,"make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to",Dracula
345,"sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on",Dracula
345,watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging,Dracula
345,"over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only",Dracula
345,comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would,Dracula
345,"be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.",Dracula
345,Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;,Dracula
345,"they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher",Dracula
345,lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following,Dracula
345,"of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead",Dracula
345,"their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When",Dracula
345,"they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look",Dracula
345,after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they,Dracula
345,"can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and",Dracula
345,"can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through",Dracula
345,"the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike",Dracula
345,"us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes",Dracula
345,home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into,Dracula
345,a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the,Dracula
345,furnace door....,Dracula

345,"is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only",Dracula
345,"a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of",Dracula
345,anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every,Dracula
345,"time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the",Dracula
345,kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong,Dracula
345,"in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big",Dracula
345,"and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,",Dracula
345,"and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,",Dracula
345,"so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a",Dracula
345,Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we,Dracula
345,have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every,Dracula
345,"deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose",Dracula
345,"to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,",Dracula
345,going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This,Dracula
345,"was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the",Dracula
345,boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu,Dracula
345,"we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the",Dracula
345,night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell,Dracula
345,"upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he",Dracula
345,shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor,Dracula
345,dear Mina and me.,Dracula

345,"_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not",Dracula
345,"wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and",Dracula
345,was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept,Dracula
345,"so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new",Dracula
345,"man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do",Dracula
345,"all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and",Dracula
345,keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to,Dracula
345,"me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to",Dracula
345,Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the,Dracula
345,"carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they",Dracula
345,would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am,Dracula
345,afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we,Dracula
345,cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how,Dracula
345,Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless,Dracula
345,"streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them",Dracula
345,"are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible",Dracula
345,doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have,Dracula
345,met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see,Dracula
345,"them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be",Dracula

345,"only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and",Dracula
345,"evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got",Dracula
345,"up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The",Dracula
345,"horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go",Dracula
345,willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many,Dracula
345,changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to,Dracula
345,think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;,Dracula
345,"he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well",Dracula
345,"to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and",Dracula
345,off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable,Dracula
345,"kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full",Dracula
345,"of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first",Dracula
345,"house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my",Dracula
345,"forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to",Dracula
345,keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an,Dracula
345,extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever,Dracula
345,"since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have",Dracula
345,"escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no",Dracula
345,"driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay",Dracula
345,that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The,Dracula
345,"Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he",Dracula
345,"made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he",Dracula
345,"says that I answered as usual ""darkness, lapping water and creaking",Dracula
345,"wood""; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of",Dracula
345,"Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write",Dracula
345,this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.,Dracula
345,"Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and",Dracula
345,"grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep",Dracula
345,he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make,Dracula
345,"him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,",Dracula
345,and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be,Dracula
345,needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.,Dracula

345,"that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep",Dracula
345,us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered,Dracula
345,"""darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,"" so the river is changing as",Dracula
345,they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of,Dracula
345,danger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.,Dracula

345,"_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as",Dracula
345,"we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed",Dracula
345,"so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us",Dracula
345,and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an,Dracula
345,effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.,Dracula
345,Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The,Dracula
345,"houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse",Dracula
345,"we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He",Dracula
345,"got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude",Dracula
345,"four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no",Dracula
345,"trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can",Dracula
345,drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive,Dracula
345,"before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what",Dracula
345,will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor,Dracula
345,"darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and",Dracula
345,"that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,",Dracula
345,"and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His",Dracula

345,"alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey",Dracula
345,"heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all",Dracula
345,winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have,Dracula
345,affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was,Dracula
345,"not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual",Dracula
345,"so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost",Dracula
345,"her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so",Dracula
345,faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.,Dracula
345,"However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh",Dracula
345,"and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset",Dracula
345,"I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown",Dracula

345,"must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go",Dracula
345,unrecorded.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I,Dracula
345,saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our,Dracula
345,"carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a",Dracula
345,"couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but",Dracula
345,"more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As",Dracula
345,"before, came the answer: ""darkness and the swirling of water."" Then she",Dracula
345,"woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.",Dracula
345,"At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new",Dracula
345,"guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""This is the way.""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""How know you it?"" I ask.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Of course I know it,"" she answer, and with a pause, add: ""Have not my",Dracula
345,"Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one",Dracula
345,"such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach",Dracula
345,"road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and",Dracula
345,more of use.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we,Dracula
345,"sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow",Dracula
345,"have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and",Dracula
345,they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan,Dracula
345,"have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long",Dracula
345,"hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and",Dracula
345,"she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to",Dracula
345,"suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may",Dracula
345,not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm,Dracula
345,"her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be",Dracula
345,"all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel",Dracula
345,"guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the",Dracula
345,"reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I",Dracula
345,look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset,Dracula
345,"time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,",Dracula
345,so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.,Dracula
345,"For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though",Dracula
345,it were the end of the world.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and",Dracula
345,"then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as",Dracula
345,"though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and",Dracula
345,"myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.",Dracula
345,"Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,",Dracula
345,and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we,Dracula
345,"first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she",Dracula
345,is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I,Dracula
345,"light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she",Dracula
345,"prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,",Dracula
345,to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go,Dracula
345,"to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that",Dracula
345,"she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have",Dracula
345,"grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She",Dracula
345,help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the,Dracula
345,"fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all",Dracula
345,"of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying",Dracula
345,"quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice",Dracula
345,"more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I",Dracula
345,wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes,Dracula
345,"obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then",Dracula
345,"sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have",Dracula
345,"to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have",Dracula
345,"harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look",Dracula
345,in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it,Dracula
345,"not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even",Dracula

345,"began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as",Dracula

345,them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make,Dracula
345,"Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid",Dracula
345,"her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that",Dracula
345,"she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But",Dracula
345,"I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the",Dracula
345,"fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round",Dracula
345,"where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and",Dracula
345,I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the,Dracula
345,time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the,Dracula
345,"snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she",Dracula
345,"clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to",Dracula
345,"feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when",Dracula
345,she had grown more quiet:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Will you not come over to the fire?"" for I wished to make a test of",Dracula
345,"what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she",Dracula
345,"stopped, and stood as one stricken.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Why not go on?"" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat",Dracula
345,"down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked",Dracula
345,"from sleep, she said simply:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I cannot!"" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she",Dracula
345,"could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be",Dracula
345,"danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I",Dracula
345,"came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they",Dracula
345,"whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a",Dracula
345,"time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to",Dracula
345,the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was,Dracula
345,"with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was",Dracula
345,"about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying",Dracula
345,sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of,Dracula
345,"some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the",Dracula
345,snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with,Dracula
345,"trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses",Dracula
345,"whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to",Dracula
345,fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that,Dracula
345,"ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of",Dracula
345,"the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and",Dracula
345,all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's,Dracula
345,horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist,Dracula
345,"began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy",Dracula
345,glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses,Dracula
345,"cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even",Dracula
345,"the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I",Dracula
345,feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and,Dracula
345,"circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when",Dracula
345,"I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held",Dracula
345,"me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low",Dracula
345,it was:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!"" I turned to her, and",Dracula
345,"looking in her eyes, said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""But you? It is for you that I fear!"" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low",Dracula
345,"and unreal, and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them",Dracula
345,"than I am,"" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of",Dracula
345,"wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.",Dracula
345,"Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the",Dracula
345,"wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without",Dracula
345,the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not,Dracula
345,"take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me",Dracula
345,"in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when",Dracula
345,"they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the",Dracula
345,"bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous",Dracula
345,lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came,Dracula
345,"through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to",Dracula
345,"her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were",Dracula
345,of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!"" In fear I turned to my poor",Dracula
345,"Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the",Dracula
345,"terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my",Dracula
345,"heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I",Dracula
345,"seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the",Dracula
345,"Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and",Dracula
345,"laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for",Dracula
345,I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not,Dracula
345,"approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within",Dracula
345,"the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The",Dracula
345,"horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on",Dracula
345,"them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor",Dracula
345,beasts no more of terror.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the,Dracula
345,"snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but",Dracula
345,when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.,Dracula
345,At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the,Dracula
345,whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away,Dracula
345,"towards the castle, and were lost.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending",Dracula
345,"to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I",Dracula
345,"could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made",Dracula
345,"no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have",Dracula
345,"made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have",Dracula
345,"much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there",Dracula
345,"may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist",Dracula
345,"obscure it, will be to me a safety.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible",Dracula
345,"work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her",Dracula
345,sleep....,Dracula

345,and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy",Dracula
345,"at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left",Dracula
345,"Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.",Dracula
345,The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was,Dracula
345,useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty,Dracula
345,"hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that",Dracula
345,being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served,Dracula
345,"me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I",Dracula
345,knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if,Dracula
345,"there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either",Dracula
345,there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.,Dracula
345,"Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.",Dracula
345,The dilemma had me between his horns.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the",Dracula
345,Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I,Dracula
345,"resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must",Dracula
345,"submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and",Dracula
345,freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the,Dracula
345,"choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than",Dracula
345,the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are,Dracula
345,"inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her",Dracula
345,"Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as",Dracula
345,"though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when",Dracula
345,"such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,",Dracula
345,"found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,",Dracula
345,"and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the",Dracula
345,"wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset",Dracula
345,"come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair",Dracula
345,"woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a",Dracula
345,kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire,Dracula
345,fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence",Dracula
345,"of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and",Dracula
345,"heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such",Dracula
345,"as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,",Dracula
345,with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a,Dracula
345,yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my,Dracula
345,"very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the",Dracula
345,strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it,Dracula
345,"was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields",Dracula
345,"to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a",Dracula
345,"long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound",Dracula
345,of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching",Dracula
345,"away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not",Dracula
345,"pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should",Dracula
345,"begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in",Dracula
345,a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister,Dracula
345,"which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of",Dracula
345,"the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so",Dracula
345,"exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls",Dracula
345,"some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl",Dracula
345,"with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam",Dracula
345,"Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought",Dracula
345,"further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had",Dracula
345,"searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as",Dracula
345,there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the,Dracula
345,"night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.",Dracula
345,"There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and",Dracula
345,nobly proportioned. On it was but one word,Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,"This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more",Dracula
345,were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.,Dracula
345,Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my,Dracula
345,"awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished",Dracula
345,"him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it",Dracula
345,"had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had",Dracula
345,been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet,Dracula
345,"Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived",Dracula
345,"through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the",Dracula
345,"years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by",Dracula
345,"thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of",Dracula
345,"fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though",Dracula
345,"till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen",Dracula
345,"the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just",Dracula
345,"ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been",Dracula
345,"won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have",Dracula
345,endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of,Dracula
345,"writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and",Dracula
345,"left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them",Dracula
345,"now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death",Dracula
345,"for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife",Dracula
345,"severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and",Dracula
345,"crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come",Dracula
345,"centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud ""I",Dracula

345,_Mina Harker's Journal._,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I,Dracula
345,took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did,Dracula
345,"not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take",Dracula
345,heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being,Dracula
345,left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our,Dracula
345,"provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we",Dracula
345,"could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of",Dracula
345,"habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy",Dracula
345,walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the,Dracula
345,clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under,Dracula
345,the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the,Dracula
345,"Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,",Dracula
345,"perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with",Dracula
345,seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain,Dracula
345,on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We,Dracula
345,"could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the",Dracula
345,"sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was",Dracula
345,full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about,Dracula
345,"that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less",Dracula
345,exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we,Dracula
345,could trace it through the drifted snow.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined",Dracula
345,"him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,",Dracula
345,with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the,Dracula
345,"hand and drew me in: ""See!"" he said, ""here you will be in shelter; and",Dracula
345,"if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one."" He brought in our",Dracula
345,"furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and",Dracula
345,forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was,Dracula
345,"repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could",Dracula
345,"not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not",Dracula
345,"reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top",Dracula
345,"of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look! Madam Mina, look! look!"" I sprang up and stood beside him on the",Dracula
345,rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling,Dracula
345,"more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning",Dracula
345,"to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the",Dracula
345,snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we,Dracula
345,"were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the",Dracula
345,"white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in",Dracula
345,kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far,Dracula
345,"off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a",Dracula
345,"group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a",Dracula
345,"long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail",Dracula
345,"wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the",Dracula
345,"snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were",Dracula
345,peasants or gypsies of some kind.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I",Dracula
345,"felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and",Dracula
345,"well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned",Dracula
345,"there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all",Dracula
345,"pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,",Dracula
345,"however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round",Dracula
345,"the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last",Dracula
345,"night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""At least you shall be safe here from _him_!"" He took the glasses from",Dracula
345,"me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.",Dracula
345,"""See,"" he said, ""they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and",Dracula
345,"galloping as hard as they can."" He paused and went on in a hollow",Dracula
345,voice:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be",Dracula
345,"done!"" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole",Dracula
345,"landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his",Dracula
345,glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the",Dracula
345,south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow,Dracula
345,"blots it all out!"" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward",Dracula
345,and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.,Dracula
345,At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around,Dracula
345,"I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at",Dracula
345,"break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,",Dracula
345,"of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with",Dracula
345,"the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,",Dracula
345,"and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he",Dracula
345,laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the,Dracula
345,"opening of our shelter. ""They are all converging,"" he said. ""When the",Dracula
345,"time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides."" I got out my revolver",Dracula
345,"ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came",Dracula
345,louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.,Dracula
345,"It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,",Dracula
345,"and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down",Dracula
345,towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could,Dracula
345,see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger,Dracula
345,numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in,Dracula
345,"fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in",Dracula
345,circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;,Dracula
345,"but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to",Dracula
345,clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of,Dracula
345,"late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew",Dracula
345,with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the,Dracula
345,sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less,Dracula
345,than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various,Dracula
345,bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer,Dracula
345,"and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly",Dracula
345,"had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,",Dracula
345,the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each,Dracula
345,"party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did",Dracula
345,"not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they",Dracula
345,"seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower",Dracula
345,and lower on the mountain tops.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind,Dracula
345,"our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined",Dracula
345,that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our,Dracula
345,presence.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"All at once two voices shouted out to: ""Halt!"" One was my Jonathan's,",Dracula
345,raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute,Dracula
345,"tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but",Dracula
345,"there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were",Dracula
345,"spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming",Dracula
345,and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the,Dracula
345,"other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his",Dracula
345,"horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his",Dracula
345,companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang,Dracula
345,"forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an",Dracula
345,unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van,Dracula
345,Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.,Dracula
345,Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew,Dracula
345,up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the,Dracula
345,"gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held",Dracula
345,himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in",Dracula
345,"front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill",Dracula
345,"tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.",Dracula
345,"For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses",Dracula
345,and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing,Dracula
345,"Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been",Dracula
345,"upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,",Dracula
345,surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our,Dracula
345,"parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly",Dracula
345,"formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one",Dracula
345,shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the,Dracula
345,order.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring,Dracula
345,"of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was",Dracula
345,evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun,Dracula
345,should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the,Dracula
345,"levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor",Dracula
345,"the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their",Dracula
345,"attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his",Dracula
345,"purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they",Dracula
345,"cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the",Dracula
345,"cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great",Dracula
345,"box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.",Dracula
345,Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of,Dracula
345,"Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,",Dracula
345,"with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had",Dracula
345,"seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and",Dracula
345,"they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first",Dracula
345,I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang,Dracula
345,"beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that",Dracula
345,"with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was",Dracula
345,"spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for",Dracula
345,"as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,",Dracula
345,"attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked",Dracula
345,the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the,Dracula
345,"lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and",Dracula
345,the top of the box was thrown back.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,",Dracula
345,"and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made",Dracula
345,"no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the",Dracula
345,shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count,Dracula
345,"lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from",Dracula
345,"the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen",Dracula
345,"image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I",Dracula
345,knew too well.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them",Dracula
345,turned to triumph.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.",Dracula
345,I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same,Dracula
345,moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the",Dracula
345,"drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from",Dracula
345,our sight.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final,Dracula
345,"dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never",Dracula
345,could have imagined might have rested there.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone",Dracula
345,of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the,Dracula
345,setting sun.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary",Dracula
345,"disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as",Dracula
345,if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the,Dracula
345,"leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,",Dracula
345,"which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving",Dracula
345,us alone.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his",Dracula
345,hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I,Dracula
345,"flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the",Dracula
345,two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his,Dracula
345,"head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand",Dracula
345,in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of,Dracula
345,"my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!"" he cried",Dracula
345,"suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, ""It was",Dracula
345,"worth for this to die! Look! look!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams",Dracula
345,"fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse",Dracula
345,"the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest ""Amen"" broke from all",Dracula
345,as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man,Dracula
345,spoke:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not",Dracula
345,"more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!""",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a",Dracula

345,,Dracula
345,Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of,Dracula
345,"some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It",Dracula
345,is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same,Dracula
345,"day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the",Dracula
345,secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into,Dracula
345,him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but,Dracula
345,we call him Quincey.,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went",Dracula
345,"over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and",Dracula
345,terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things,Dracula
345,which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were,Dracula
345,living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The,Dracula
345,"castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.",Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all,Dracula
345,"look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily",Dracula
345,married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since,Dracula
345,"our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the",Dracula
345,"mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one",Dracula
345,"authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later",Dracula
345,"note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.",Dracula
345,"We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as",Dracula
345,"proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with",Dracula
345,our boy on his knee:--,Dracula
345,,Dracula
345,"""We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day",Dracula
345,know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her,Dracula
345,sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so,Dracula
345,"loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.""",Dracula
